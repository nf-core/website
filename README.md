# [nf-co.re](https://github.com/nf-core/website)

This repository contains code for the nf-core website: **<http://nf-co.re/>**

## Packages used

Here's how the website is built:

- Language: Javascript
- Frameworks:
  - [Astro](https://astro.build/) (static site generator),
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (interactive components),
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) (CSS framework)
- Tools:
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (package manager)

## Development

### Getting the code

To make edits to the website, fork the repository to your own user on GitHub and then clone to your local system.

```bash
gh repo fork nf-core/website nf-core_website
cd nf-core_website/
```

### Installing dependencies

The website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator.
To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running a local server

Ok, you're ready! The website is split up into sub-sites using npm workspaces ([see blogpost](https://nf-co.re/blog/2024/new-website-structure)). One usually works on just one sub-site, e.g., `sites/main-site` for blog posts, event pages and general code components, or `sites/docs` for changes to the documentation. To run the website locally, just start astro dev mode for the specific workspace,e.g.:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace sites/main-site
```

or

```bash
npm run dev --workspace sites/docs
```

You should then be able to access the website in your browser at [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/). Some pages will not work when rendered using a specific dev server because the sub-sites are disjunct from each other, e.g., when starting the local server for `sites/docs`, [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/) the [http://localhost:4321/pipelines](http://localhost:4321/pipelines) pages will throw 404 errors.

### File structure

The website follows a mono-repo setup with sub-sites.
The main sub-sites are:

- `sites/main-site` - The main nf-core website, including components, events, blog posts
- `sites/configs` - listing pages for nf-core configs
- `sites/docs` - docs pages
- `sites/modules-subworkflows` - modules and subworkflows pages
- `sites/pipelines` - pipeline pages
- `sites/pipeline-results` - AWS megatest result pages for each pipeline (split up from the rest to allow static generation of the main pipeline pages)

Each site has its own `src` directory with the following structure, typical for an [Astro project](https://docs.astro.build/guides/project-structure):

- `src/pages/` - Astro pages
- `src/content/` - [Astro content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) (markdown files for events, docs, blog)
- `src/components/` - Astro/Svelte components
- `src/layouts/` - HTML layouts
- `src/styles/` - (S)CSS stylesheets
- `public/` - Static files (images, json files etc)

## Adding an event

To add an event, create a new markdown (or .mdx) file in `sites/main-site/src/content/events/` with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
title: "Event Title"
subtitle: "A brief overview of the event"
type: "talk"  # Can be "talk", "hackathon", "training", "bytesize"
startDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
endDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
startTime: "HH:MM"
endTime: "HH:MM"
announcement:
  text: "Text on the announcement banner" # (optional)
  start: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM" # (required if announcement.text is used)
  end: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM" # (required if announcement.text is used)
locations: # (optional)
  name: "Name of the location" # (optional)
  links: "URL(s) to the location or to the section in the text with location description (e.g. `#gather-town`)" # (optional)
  geoCoordinates: [48.2082, 16.3738] # Latitude and longitude of the location as an array " (optional)
  address: "Address of the location" #(optional)
duration: "Duration of the event in days" (optional)
embedAt: "in case this should be shown in the sidebar of a pipeline page (e.g. for a bytesize talk about the pipeline)" (optional)
importTypeform: true # If true, the event will be imported from a Typeform (see below)
```

## Adding a blog post

To add a blog post, create a new markdown (or mdx) file in `sites/main-site/src/content/blog/` with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
subtitle: "A brief overview of your post's content"
headerImage: "Direct URL to an optional header image" (optional)
headerImageAlt: "Descriptive alt text for the header image (mandatory if a header image is used)"
pubDate: "Scheduled publication date and time (the post will go live post-website rebuild if the current date surpasses this timestamp). Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM" (without quotes!)
authors: ["Author's Name"]  // Use a list format even if there is only one author.
label: ["Category1", "Category2"]  // This is optional and can include multiple categories.
announcement:
  text: "Text on the announcement banner" # (optional)
  start: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM" # (required if announcement.text is used)
  end: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM" # (required if announcement.text is used)
```

### Adding an announcement banner

You can show a short announcement banner on the website by adding additional information to the frontmatter of either a file inside `sites/main-site/src/content/blog` or `sites/main-site/src/content/events`. The following fields are available:

```yaml
announcement:
  text: "Your announcement text"
  start: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM # Start date and time of the announcement (without quotes!)
  end: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM # End date and time of the announcement. (without quotes!) This is an optional field for events, where the start date of the event is the end date of the announcement by default.
```

### Updating the JSON files and cached markdown

Much of the site is powered by the JSON files in `/public` and the cached markdown files (from the pipeline docs) in `/.cache`.

They come pre-built with the repository, but if you want to rebuild them then you'll need to run the following commands. Note that you need to add a GITHUB_TOKEN inside a `.env` file to avoid hitting API limits (too early). See [instructions on how to get a GitHub OAuth token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) (the token only needs the `public_repo` permission).

```bash
npm run build-pipeline-json
npm run build-component-json
npm run build-cache-force
```

### Adding a new sub-site to the mono-repo

The following steps are necessary to add a new sub-site to the mono-repo:

- [ ] Copy the `sites/pipelines` directory to a new directory with the name of the new sub-site, e.g. newsite.
- [ ] Update the following files in the new directory:

  - [ ] `astro.config.mjs`
    - [ ] Update the `assetsPrefix` field to point to the new site's netlify URL, e.g. `assetsPrefix: 'https://nf-core-website-newsite.netlify.app/'`.
  - [ ] `package.json` - Update the `name` field to the new site name, e.g. `"name": "newsite"`.
  - [ ] `netlify.toml` - Update the paths in the `command` and the `ignore` field to point to the new site's source directory, e.g.

  ```toml
  command = "npm run build -w sites/newsite"
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF sites/main-site/src/components sites/main-site/src/layouts sites/newsite"
  ```

### Tools API docs

nf-core/tools API reference docs are built using Sphinx via the `add-tools-api-docs.yml` GitHub Action and a webhook from the nf-core/tools repo.

## Contribution guidelines

If you are looking forward to contribute to the website or add your institution to the official list of contributors, please have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Crafting a Blog Post

To publish a new blog post on the website, you'll need to create a Markdown file within the `sites/main-site/src/content/blog/` directory. In this file, include the following frontmatter at the beginning:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
subtitle: "A brief overview of your post's content"
headerImage: "Direct URL to an optional header image"
headerImageAlt: "Descriptive alt text for the header image (mandatory if a header image is used)"
pubDate: "Scheduled publication date and time (the post will go live post-website rebuild if the current date surpasses this timestamp). Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000+HH:MM"
authors: ["Author's Name"]  // Use a list format even if there is only one author.
label: ["Category1", "Category2"]  // This is optional and can include multiple categories.
---
```

> [!NOTE]
> The blog post will be visible on the website only if a rebuild of the site occurs after the date and time specified in the `pubDate` field.

By default the first paragraph of the blog post will be used as the preview text on the blog page. If you want to use a different paragraph, add the following comment after the paragraph you want to use:

```markdown
<!-- end of excerpt -->
```

or for MDX

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```mdx
/* end of excerpt */
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
