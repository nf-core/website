To delete a subworkflow from your pipeline, run `nf-core subworkflows remove`.

You can pass the subworkflow name as an optional argument to `nf-core subworkflows remove` like above or select it from the list of available subworkflows by only running `nf-core subworkflows remove`. To specify the pipeline directory, use `--dir <pipeline_dir>`.
