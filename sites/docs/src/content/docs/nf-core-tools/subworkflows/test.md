All subworkflows on [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) have a strict requirement of being unit tested using minimal test data. We use [nf-test](https://code.askimed.com/nf-test/) as our testing framework.
Each subworkflow comes already with a template for the test file in `test/main.nf.test`. Replace the placeholder code in that file with your specific input, output and proces. In order to generate the corresponding snapshot after writing your test, you can use the `nf-core subworkflows test` command. This command will run `nf-test test` twice, to also check for snapshot stability, i.e. that the same snapshot is generated on multiple runs.

You can specify the subworkflow name in the command or provide it later through interactive prompts.

In case you changed something in the test and want to update the snapshot, run

```bash
nf-core subworkflows test --update
```

If you want to run the test only once without checking for snapshot stability, you can use the `--once` flag.
