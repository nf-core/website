The `nf-core subworkflows list` command provides the subcommands `remote` and `local` for listing subworkflows installed in a remote repository and in the local pipeline respectively. Both subcommands allow to use a pattern for filtering the subworkflows by keywords eg: `nf-core subworkflows list <subworkflow_name> <keyword>`.

## List remote subworkflows

To list all subworkflows available on [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules), you can use
`nf-core subworkflows list remote`, which will print all available subworkflows to the terminal.

## List installed subworkflows

To list subworkflows installed in a local pipeline directory you can use `nf-core subworkflows list local`. This will list the subworkflows install in the current working directory by default. If you want to specify another directory, use the `--dir <pipeline_dir>` flag.
