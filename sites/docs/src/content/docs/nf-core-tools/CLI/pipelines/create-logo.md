The `nf-core pipelines create-logo` command creates a logo for your pipeline based on the nf-core template and pipeline name.

Use `--width` to set the logo width in pixels.
Use `--format` to choose between `png` or `svg` output.
The default format is `png`.

Run `nf-core pipelines create-logo <text>`, for example:

<!-- RICH-CODEX
working_dir: tmp
-->
