The `nf-core` command line interface is fairly large, with a lot of commands and options.
To make it easier to explore and use, run `nf-core tui` to launch a graphical terminal interface.

This functionality works using [Textualize/trogon](https://github.com/Textualize/trogon)
and is based on the underlying CLI implementation that uses [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/).
