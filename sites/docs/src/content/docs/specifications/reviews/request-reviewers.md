The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Actively request reviewers and feedback

Pull request authors and reviewers SHOULD proactively request help for review in the nf-core Slack workspace.

For general pull request reviews, use the `#request-review` channel. For pipeline release reviews specifically, please use the [#release-review-trading](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08K66XCZSL) channel.

:::tip
Requesting reviews in the appropriate Slack channel helps ensure your pull request gets timely attention from community members with relevant expertise.

## Collaborative improvements

We encourage collaboration on pull requests. Other contributors are welcome to:

- Fix linting errors identified by automated checks
- Make improvements to the code if necessary
- Mention relevant bot commands to help resolve issues
