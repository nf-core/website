The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Managing review feedback

The review process should be flexible and pragmatic while ensuring code quality. These guidelines help balance thoroughness with forward progress.

## Dismissing outdated reviews

**Request changes** reviews MAY be [dismissed](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review) by the PR author if considered out of date and resolved.

## Addressing open questions

Pull requests that have approving reviews but remaining open questions MAY be merged by the author after addressing the questions to a common-sense level of satisfaction.

Not every question requires a perfect answer before merging. Use reasonable judgment to determine when concerns have been adequately addressed.

## Handling abandoned reviews

If a PR has comments from one reviewer with open questions, and they request to re-review but do not perform the re-review:

- The PR MAY be merged if the first reviewer does not finish the review after **3 months**
- The PR must have received an independent approval from someone else

:::tip
If you find yourself waiting for a re-review, consider:

- Following up with the reviewer in Slack
- Requesting review from additional community members
- Clearly documenting how you addressed the original concerns
