The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Pipelines SHOULD have excellent documentation.

Repositories SHOULD have [GitHub Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) set on the nf-core repository.

:::info{title="Rationale" collapse}
GitHub Topics are shown on the nf-core website and used for categorisation and searching.
They are important for workflow visibility and findability.
:::

Topics MAY be related to the workflow, tools, data or any related aspect.
