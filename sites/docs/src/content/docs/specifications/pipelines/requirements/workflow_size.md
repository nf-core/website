The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

nf-core pipelines SHOULD follow a _"not too big, not too small"_ rule.

Workflows SHOULD contain at least three processes and be simple enough to run that a new user can realistically run the pipeline after spending ten minutes reading the docs.

Pipelines SHOULD be general enough to be of use to multiple groups and research projects, but comprehensive enough to cover most steps in a primary analysis.
