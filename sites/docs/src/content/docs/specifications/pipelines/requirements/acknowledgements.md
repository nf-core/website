The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Where previous work from other pipelines or projects is used within a pipeline, the original author(s) MUST be properly acknowledged.

The following practices SHOULD be followed to ensure proper acknowledgement:

- Send the original authors a message via Slack to inform them of your use of their work. Check with them to see how they would like to be acknowledged.
- Check the license of their code and graphics components and ensure you obey the rules that this license imposes (e.g., `CC-BY` requires attribution of the original creator).
- If you use portions of pipeline code, even small pieces:
  - Link to the original repository and authors.
  - Leave existing credits and acknowledgement sections intact - there may be more than just a single author involved.
- If you find bugs or issues, report and fix them upstream in the main project.

If in doubt about what to do, ask the nf-core community about it on Slack.
