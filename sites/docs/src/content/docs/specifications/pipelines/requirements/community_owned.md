The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

:::info{title="Rationale" collapse}
The nf-core community was founded to allow different groups to collaborate on pipelines.
One of the strengths of this approach is that pipelines are not tied to a specific group or individual.
This means that as people's time commitments and funding change, maintenance of a pipeline can shift between groups and stay up to date.
:::

By adding a pipeline to nf-core, you MUST agree to working in our collaborative ecosystem:

- You MUST be willing to work with other contributors
- Decisions about the pipeline will be made based on community consensus (with final say from core team and steering if needed, see [governance](/governance))
- Other people MAY add features and make releases

The following are explicitly permitted:

- Publication of the pipeline by the primary developers
- Use and publicity of the pipeline and nf-core
