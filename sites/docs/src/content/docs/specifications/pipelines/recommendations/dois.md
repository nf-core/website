The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

Pipelines SHOULD have digital object identifiers (DOIs) for easy referencing in literature.

Each release SHOULD have a DOI generated by [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
This can be automated through linkage with the GitHub repository.
