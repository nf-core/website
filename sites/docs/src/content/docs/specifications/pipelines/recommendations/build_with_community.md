The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", etc. are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

nf-core is a community of builders, not a registry of pipelines.

You SHOULD come and discuss your ideas and propose your pipeline before starting work on it, rather than proposing an already-complete pipeline.

This means that you can develop with the community, potentially finding collaborators.
It provides a checkpoint that there are not already existing pipelines which you can contribute to, instead of starting new.
It also means that you can check that your pipeline is suitable for nf-core before putting time into development.
This includes any necessary adjustments, which are often easier to do early in the development process.
