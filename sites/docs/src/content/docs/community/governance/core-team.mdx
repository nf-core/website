This page provides detailed procedures for nf-core core team administrative tasks.
Core team members rotate week 'on-call' duties to manage community operations and support pipeline development.

## Review and onboard new pipelines

To approve and setup a new [nf-core pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals):

1. **Core**: Update the _project status_ on the issue to 'Proposed'
1. **Community**: Discuss benefits and limitations of the proposal:

    - Emphasise collaboration

        :::note
        nf-core prefers to have more developers working on fewer pipelines, rather than many pipelines with a single developer.
        :::

    - Ensure proposal follows [nf-core pipeline guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/overview).
    - In some cases, promote 'partial acceptance', i.e., if upstream steps already covered in another pipeline, propose new pipeline of just non-overlapping steps.

1. **Core**: Check proposal has received approval in [nf-core/proposals](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) from either:
    - Two members of the core team.
    - One member of the core team and one member of the maintainers team.
1. **Core**: Make final decision:
    - If accepted: update the Project status on the issue to 'Accepted'.
    - If not accepted: update the project status to 'Turned down' (process ends here).
1. **Core**: Verify that the pipeline name follows the [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/requirements/workflow_name)
1. **Core**: Create a slack channel with approved pipeline name:
    - Inform the new developer of the [next steps](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/adding_a_pipeline/creating_a_pipeline#create-the-pipeline).
1. **Core**: Add the main developer(s) to:
    - [#pipeline-maintainers](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04QR0T3G3H).
    - [#release-review-trading](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08K66XCZSL).
1. **Core**: Create a branch with the pipeline name in the [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) repository.
1. **Core/Dev**: Set up the pipeline repository:
    - If development started in a custom (non-nf-core) repo, [transfer the repository](https://nf-co.re/docs/checklists/community_governance/core_team#repository-transfer-to-nf-core-organisation) to nf-core.
    - If starting fresh, create a new GitHub repository with the name of the pipeline.
1. **Core**: Add the pipeline name to the [website YAML file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/75a92b76129b0e2c3f644bf26482142ba9e41f6f/sites/main-site/src/config/ignored_repos.yaml) designated to ignore this repository when building the website pipeline list.
1. **Core/Dev**: Use `nf-core pipelines create` to create a git repository and push it to GitHub.
1. **Core/Dev**: Once first release (mostly) ready:
    - Transfer the repository to nf-core GitHub organisation and remove the repository on the local machine/user account.
1. **Core/Dev**: After first release, remove the pipeline name from the [website YAML file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/75a92b76129b0e2c3f644bf26482142ba9e41f6f/sites/main-site/src/config/ignored_repos.yaml) ignoring this pipeline from the build, if it is listed.
1. **Core/Dev**: Trigger the [GitHub action](https://github.com/nf-core/website/actions/workflows/build-json-files.yml) to sync the `nf-co.re` pipelines page:
    - **Website repo > Actions > Build json files and md-cache > Run workflow > From main**.

## Upload test data to a S3 bucket

To upload full-test AWS files for to a S3 bucket:

1. Check the test data is valid.

    :::note
    Small input data may be unreliable when downloaded from other repositories (e.g., limit total file size to < 10 GB total).
    :::

1. Check that large files cannot be reduced or subset.
1. Select Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) and create the pipeline directory in the S3 bucket.

## Transfer a repository to nf-core

To transfer an existing repository to the nf-core GitHub organisation:

1. Request repository ownership transfer from the developer.
    - If the repository is under an organisation account, ask the developer to add a core team member as a co-owner.
    - If the repository is under a personal user account, ask the developer to transfer ownership directly to a core team member's personal account.
1. Transfer the repository to the nf-core organisation.
    - In the repository, go to **Settings**, scroll to the bottom of the **General** page, and select **Transfer**
    - Confirm or update the repository name if needed.
1. Configure repository settings in the nf-core organisation.

    - Ask Matthias for the repository ruleset JSON files.

        :::note
        These are still under development, but pinned in the core channel
        :::

    1. In the repository, go to **Settings**.
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Rules**.
    1. Select **New ruleset**.
    1. Select **Import a ruleset**, then select a JSON file.
    1. Select **Create** at the bottom of the page.

        :::warning
        Do not modify any fields
        :::

    1. Repeat the import and create steps for each JSON file provided.

## Create custom Docker containers for modules

To add a custom docker containers to the nf-core [https://quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/nf-core) organisation:

:::note
The person building the container must have organisation push rights.
**Only core members may have this access**. New core members should request access from existing members.
:::

1. Check with the module author to ensure there is no available solution via Conda, Bioconda, or BioContainers.
1. Ask the module author to:
    - Place a `Dockerfile` alongside the module (sub)directories
    - Add a `README.md` describing why the container is needed, and provide instructions for building the container
    - (Optional) add a `.gitignore` file to ensure build artifacts are not pushed with the `Dockerfile` and `README.md`
1. Ensure Docker is correctly authenticated for pushing to `quay.io`.

    ```bash
    docker login --username <QUAY_USER_NAME> quay.io
    ```

1. Build the Docker image locally and tag it appropriately:

    ```bash
    docker build . -t quay.io/nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>
    ```

1. Push the built container image:

    ```bash
    docker push quay.io/nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>
    ```

1. Share the container reference with the module author so they can update the module:

    ```groovy
    container "nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>"
    ```

    :::note
    This replaces the entire Docker/Singularity condition in the module.
    :::

## Activate Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

To set up up Zenodo DOI:

:::note
It's recommended that a core team member transfers the DOI to the nf-core Zenodo community.
:::

1.  Before release:

    1.  Sign up and log in to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
    1.  Select **GitHub -> Connect Account** in the dropdown menu of your account and connect your GitHub account.
    1.  Select **GitHub** in the dropdown menu of your account once connected.
    1.  Toggle the **On** switch of the pipeline to enable Zenodo archiving.

            :::note
            It's a good idea to enable this for all active pipelines, as DOIs will only be assigned upon release.
            :::

            :::note
            Some repositories (e.g., `nf-core/exoseq`) may not be activated as they are archived.
            :::

    1.  Inform the pipeline developers to make a release.

1.  Post release:

    1. Select **Github** in the dropdown menu of your account in Zenodo and find the relevant repository.
    1. Click the Zenodo **Record** page for the release.
    1. Find the **Communities** box on the record page and submit the record to the nf-core community.

        :::tip
        Google Chrome contains a graphical bug causing the **Communities** box not to show up, please use another browser if this happens to you.
        :::

    1. Copy the DOI for **Cite all versions?** in the **Versions** tab.
    1. Update files on the pipeline master branch:
        - `README.md`: Add the Zenodo Badge and update the **If you use this pipeline cite** section.
        - `Nextflow.config`: Update the manifest block to include the DOI.
        - Commit these changes with the message "Add Zenodo ID after first release".

## Add new community members to the GitHub organisation
