nf-core has a variety of recognisable images and other graphic designs for the community project.

To help facilitate the identification of nf-core pipelines and related material, nf-core provides a variety of files that can be used for nf-core-related content, such as pipeline logos, presentations, or workflow diagrams.

All files are released under various forms of 'open' licenses. You can re-use and re-model them as you see fit.

## Colours
