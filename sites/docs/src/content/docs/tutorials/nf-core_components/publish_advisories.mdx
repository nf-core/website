import AdvisorySidebarHeader from "@components/advisory/AdvisorySidebarHeader.astro";

Advisories are structured, long-lived notices for significant technical issues in pipelines, modules, subworkflows or configs. Advisories should focus on clarity, relevance, and practical value: if the issue is significant enough that users could waste hours chasing it down, itâ€™s probably worth an advisory. Think of it as a way to save others from stepping into the same pothole.

## Who can issue an advisory?

In short: anyone can create one. While in practice theyâ€™ll most often be written by maintainers of the affected pipelines or modules, the process is open to contributors who spot an issue worth sharing broadly.

## What to publish?

Some examples of issues that should be communicated as advisories include:

- A newly discovered issue that leads to incorrect results in a module or pipeline. This includes bugs in tools bundled within a specific pipeline version.
- Known regressions that occur with certain parameter combinations.
- Incompatibilities between a particular pipeline version and a specific Nextflow version.
- Security vulnerabilities or other issues affecting a dependency or container image.
- Problems with executors (e.g., Slurm, AWS Batch) that require special considerations.

These are the kinds of problems where a clear, structured advisory can help users avoid pitfalls and stay informed, but thereâ€™s no rigid rule on when to publish one â€” if youâ€™ve identified a problem, understand its cause, possibly even have a solid workaround or fix, thatâ€™s a great time.

## Where does one put the content?

To create an advisory, begin by forking [the nf-core website repository](https://github.com/nf-core/website) and adding a new Markdown (or MDX) file in the `sites/main-site/src/content/advisory` directory. You can for example use [the source file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/main/sites/main-site/src/content/advisories/process-shell-configuration.md) for the [process shell advisory](https://nf-co.re/advisories/process-shell-configuration) as a template.

The main body of the advisory is written in regular Markdown. Use it to clearly describe the issue, and if possible, include recommended workarounds or resolutions. Youâ€™re free to structure this section as you see fit â€” just aim for clarity and usefulness, and a constructive tone. Advisories are not the place for blame or finger-pointing. Bugs happen, and the goal here is to help the community learn and adapt, not to single out individuals or teams. You can also add references to related GitHub issues, pull requests, or Slack discussions to provide additional context.

While the narrative section is flexible, the real strength of advisories lies in their structured format: making them searchable, categorizable, and directly linkable to affected versions. To enable that structure, each advisory must begin with a frontmatter block, a YAML-style header enclosed by `---`. This is where you define all the key metadata, such as affected pipelines, dependencies, and severity. If youâ€™ve ever written a moduleâ€™s `meta.yaml`, youâ€™ll feel right at home here ðŸ˜‰.
