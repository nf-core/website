## Installation Options

### Option 1: Official Installation Script (Recommended)

The official and recommended way to install nf-test:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.nf-test.com | bash
```

If you don't have curl installed, you can use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://get.nf-test.com | bash
```

This will create the `nf-test` executable file in the current directory. Optionally, move the `nf-test` file to a directory accessible by your `$PATH` variable:

```bash
# Make it executable and move to PATH
chmod +x nf-test
sudo mv nf-test /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Install a specific version

To install a specific version, pass it to the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.nf-test.com | bash -s 0.9.0
```

### Option 2: Using Conda/Mamba

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nf-test
# or
mamba install -c bioconda nf-test
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation

Download the latest version from the [nf-test releases page](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/releases):

```bash
# Download and extract
curl -fsSL https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/releases/latest/download/nf-test.tar.gz | tar -xzf -

# Make executable and move to PATH
chmod +x nf-test
sudo mv nf-test /usr/local/bin/
```

## Verification

Verify your installation:

```bash
nf-test version
```

You should see output similar to:

```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Nextflow Binary not found?

If you get an error message about Nextflow binary not being found, you have two options:

1. **Move Nextflow to PATH**: Ensure your Nextflow binary is in a directory accessible by your `$PATH` variable
2. **Set NEXTFLOW_HOME**: Set the environment variable `NEXTFLOW_HOME` to the directory containing the Nextflow binary:

```bash
export NEXTFLOW_HOME=/path/to/nextflow/directory
```

### Updating nf-test

To update an existing nf-test installation to the latest version:

```bash
nf-test update
```

```groovy
config {
    plugins {
