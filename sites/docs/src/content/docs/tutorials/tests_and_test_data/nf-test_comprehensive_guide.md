## nf-core Testing Principles

nf-core testing follows these key principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every module, subworkflow, and pipeline should have tests
2. **Realistic Data**: Tests use representative data from standardized repositories
3. **Snapshot Testing**: Output verification through snapshots ensures consistency
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests run reliably in automated environments
5. **Standard Patterns**: Consistent testing patterns across all nf-core components

## Getting Help

For issues not covered in this guide:

- **Browse examples**: nf-core/methylseq, nf-core/sarek tests for current best practices
- **nf-test documentation**: [Official nf-test docs](https://code.askimed.com/nf-test/)
- **Community support**: [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join) `#nf-test` channel
- **nf-core modules**: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) for examples
