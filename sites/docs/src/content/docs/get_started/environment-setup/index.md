To work with nf-core pipelines, you will need to set up your computing environment with some essential tools. This section guides you through installing and configuring everything you need to get started.

## What you'll need

The core requirements for running nf-core pipelines are:

1. **[Nextflow](./nextflow.md)** - The workflow management system that powers all nf-core pipelines
2. **[Software dependency manager](./software-dependencies.md)** - A system to handle pipeline software (Docker, Singularity, or Conda)

These additional tools are recommended for development and enhanced functionality:

3. **[nf-core tools](./nf-core-tools.md)** - Command-line tools for working with nf-core pipelines (optional but recommended)
4. **[VS Code](./vs-code.md)** - A code editor with Nextflow extensions (optional, for pipeline development)

## Getting started

If you are new to nf-core, we recommend following the guides in order:

1. Start with [installing Nextflow](./nextflow.md) - this is essential for running any pipeline
2. Set up a [software dependency manager](./software-dependencies.md) - choose based on your system
3. Optionally install [nf-core tools](./nf-core-tools.md) for additional utilities and pipeline management features
4. If you plan to develop pipelines, set up [VS Code](./vs-code.md) with the Nextflow extension

:::note
System requirements and installation methods vary depending on your operating system and whether you have administrator privileges. If you are uncertain, speak to your system administrator.
