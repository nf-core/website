# VSCode

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or VSCode for short, is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
VSCode has a huge ecosystem of packages that can be installed to extend functionality.

There is official Nextflow language support with syntax highlighting and auto-completion code snippets.
To use, just search for `Nextflow` in the VSCode Packages tab search bar, or visit
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nextflow.nextflow> (see also the [source code](https://github.com/nextflow-io/vscode-language-nextflow)).

To make it easier to get up and running with the ones that are helpful when working with nf-core pipelines, we have put together an _"extension pack"_ of community favourites.
You can browse, pick and choose the ones you think look good, or can install them all in a single click.

To use, just search for `nf-core-extensionpack` in the VSCode Packages tab search bar, or visit
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nf-core.nf-core-extensionpack>

The extension pack source code can be found on GitHub and is written in super simple syntax - suggestions and improvements welcome!

# Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. It has a slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.

Much like VSCode and other code editors, Sublime Text can make use of plugins that extend the native functionality.
[@peterk87](https://github.com/peterk87) has gone the extra mile and built an incredible plugin for Sublime Text users, complete with:

- Nextflow syntax highlighting (DSL2 compliant)
- Custom commands with integration with external services (nf-core, Bioconda, Biocontainers)
- Auto-completion and rich information panels
- Common code snippets

You can get this plugin here: <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/nextflow>

The source code is on GitHub, contributors welcome:
