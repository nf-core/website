When you create a new pipeline from the nf-core template, you are presented with
a directory full of many files and folders. Some are boilerplate code that you'll
probably never need to touch. Some are important to understand whilst developing a pipeline.
Here we list the outputs of a pipeline from the template with all of the options ticked,
describing what each file is and what it does.

## Files

You will find the following files in each nf-core pipeline. They are automatically generated, when running `nf-core pipelines create`.

| Filename                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `main.nf`                | This is the main nextflow file which will get executed if the pipeline is run. Typically, parameters are initialized and validated in this script before a workflow from the `workflows/` directory is called for execution.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `nextflow.config`        | The main nextflow configuration file. It contains the default pipeline parameters, nextflow configuration options and information like pipeline and minimum nextflow version, among others. The `nextflow.config` also defines different configuration profiles that can be used to run the pipeline. See the [Configuration docs](/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration) for more information. |
| `README.md`              | Basic information about the pipeline and usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `nextflow_schema.json`   | The JSON schema file is used for pipeline parameter specification. This is automatically created using the `nf-core pipelines schema build` command. It is used for printing command-line help, validating input parameters, building the website docs and for building pipeline launch interfaces (web and cli).                                                                                   |
| `CHANGELOG.md`           | Information about the changes made to the pipeline for each release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `conf/`         | Configuration files, including a `base.config` file which is always loaded into `nextflow.config` and describes basic pipeline configurations, like CPU and memory usage for processes with low, medium and high requirements. Additionally, most pipelines also have a `igenomes.config` file which describes the locations of popular genomes that can be automatically downloaded for a pipeline run. Finally, the `test.config` and `test_full.config` files are test configurations that are loaded during test runs. Since DSL2, it also contains a `modules.config` file, which defines module-specific configurations and is explained further down in the "DSL2 and modules" section. |
