Welcome to the nf-core community!

We are looking forward to your contributions.
If this is your first time, please read the below to orient yourself on how contributing works within our community.

## Code of conduct

Before we start, please make sure you read our [code of conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct)!

This is a core document for ensuring everyone gets along well within our diverse distributed group.

## Communication

Our primary communication platforms is our Slack workspace and various GitHub repositories.

If at any point you have a question, always ask on either of those - Slack has dedicated help channels such as [#nostupidquestions](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C043FMKUNLB) and [#help](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDBX2A).

To join the Slack workspace, see our [Join nf-core](https://nf-co.re/join) page for instructions.

## Joining the Slack and GitHub organisations

After joining Slack, we encourage all contributors to join our GitHub organisation.

This is open to everyone, and has a range of benefits including not having to wait for someone to approve CI tests, reviewing and merge rights (on most repositories).

To join the GitHub workspace, see our [Join nf-core](https://nf-co.re/join) page for instructions (hint: you'll need to be on our Slack workspace ðŸ˜‰)

## Pull requests

Anyone is welcome to open a pull request on our GitHub repositories.

Before opening a pull request, we ask you to join the GitHub organisation so any tests will automatically run.

As a general rule, all pull requests must be reviewed by another community member.

## Reviewing

Reviews and comments can be either or both technical (code) and/or conceptual (e.g. purpose/background/approach).

Anyone is welcome to review or leave a comment an nf-core pull request - regardless if you are within the nf-core community or not
You also do not need to be in the nf-core GitHub organisation (although this is recommended).

We do ask however that if you review a PR about a 'conceptual' question, we ask for you to request a second technical review by another community member.
You can request reviews via the [#request-review](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CQY2U5QU9) channel on Slack.

We also encourage you to regularly get reviews from community members that are not directly within your own development team.

Be polite and constructive with your comments - we have a diverse range of backgrounds and cultures in our community.

Help with making a smooth reviewing process by making single reviews with multiple comments, not lots of separate comments (i.e., press 'Start review', **not** 'Add single comment' on the GitHub 'Files Changed' tab!)
