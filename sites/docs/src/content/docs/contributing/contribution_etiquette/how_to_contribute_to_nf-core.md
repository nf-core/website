Welcome to the nf-core community!

We are looking forward to your contributions.
If this is your first time, please read the below to orient yourself on how contributing works within our community.

## Code of conduct

The [code of conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct) is a core document for ensuring everyone gets along well within our diverse, distributed group. Before you start, take a moment to review this document.

## Communication

Our primary communication platforms is our Slack workspace and various GitHub repositories.

Popular repositories include:

- [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules): Shared Nextflow modules and subworkflows
- [nf-core/tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools): nf-core toolkit, including module, subworkflow, and pipeline templates
- [nf-core/website](https://github.com/nf-core/website): nf-core documentation
- [nf-core/testdatasets](https://github.com/nf-core/testdatasets): Shared test data files for unit testing
- [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs): Shared Nextflow configuration files for HPC and cloud infrastructure


## Joining the Slack and GitHub organisations

To join the Slack workspace, see our [Join nf-core](https://nf-co.re/join) page for instructions.

After joining Slack, we recommend you join our GitHub organisation.

The GitHub organization is open to everyone and offers a range of benefits, including not having to wait for someone to approve CI tests and reviewing and merging rights (on most repositories).

To join the GitHub workspace, see our [Join nf-core](https://nf-co.re/join) page for instructions

## Asking for help

If you have questions and don't know where to start, ask in our dedicated Slack help channels:

- [#nostupidquestions](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C043FMKUNLB)
- [#help](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDBX2A).
## Pull requests

Everyone is welcome to open a pull request on our GitHub repositories.

Before opening a pull request, join the GitHub organisation so that any tests will automatically run.

As a general rule, all pull requests must be reviewed by another community member.

## Reviewing

Reviews and comments can be technical (code), conceptual (e.g., purpose/background/approach), or both.

Everyone is welcome to review or leave a comment on an nf-core pull request - regardless of whether you are within the nf-core community or not
You also do not need to be in the nf-core GitHub organisation (although this is recommended).

However, if you review a PR about a 'conceptual' question, a second technical review by another community member is required.
You can request reviews via the [#request-review](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CQY2U5QU9) channel on Slack.

Reviews from community members who are not directly within your development team are recommended.

Be polite and constructive in your comments. Our community has a diverse range of backgrounds, cultures, and expertise.

Help with making a smooth reviewing process by making single reviews with multiple comments, not lots of separate comments (i.e., select **Start review**, not **Add single comment** on the **GitHub Files Changed** tab!)

## Who is who and how to contact them

See the [Governance](https://nf-co.re/governance#governance) page for an overview of the community structure.

As a general rule: always ask the entire community first!
The answers to the vast majority of questions can be obtained from the entire nf-core hivemind.

If you get stuck on something that needs more expert advice or a decision, there are specific teams that may be able to help:

- Issue with modules, pipelines, or test configs: Ask the maintainers team
- Questions about nf-core events or the bytesize series: Ask the outreach team
- Problems with the nf-core template, tooling, GitHub actions, or AWS: Ask the infrastructure team!
- Critical decision made that may affect the entire community, or need something done that requires passwords: Ask the core team!
- Inter-personal conflict with another member or member(s) of the community: Ask the safety team!

Members of each team are listed on the [Governance](https://nf-co.re/governance#governance) page.
