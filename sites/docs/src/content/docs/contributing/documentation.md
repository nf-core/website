## How to contribute

Contributing to nf-core documentation follows a straightforward process:

2. **Edit the content**: Make your changes following our style guide and topic types.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Propose your changes for review by the community.
4. **Respond to feedback**: Work with reviewers to refine your contribution.

If you're new to technical writing, don't worry.
The sections below provide everything you need to write clear, consistent documentation.

## Writing guidelines

Before you start writing, familiarize yourself with these essential resources:

### Style guide

The [style guide](../developers/documentation/style_guide) covers all the essential styling rules for nf-core documentation, including:

- Voice and tone guidelines for conversational, concise writing
- Grammar and punctuation rules (British English, active voice, Oxford comma)
- Capitalisation and text formatting conventions
- How to write headings, lists, links, and tables
- Guidelines for code blocks, images, and alerts

Following the style guide ensures consistency across all nf-core documentation and makes content easier to read and translate.

### Topic types

The [topic types](../developers/documentation/topic_types) page explains how to structure different kinds of documentation content framework:

- **Concept**: Explain what features are and why they matter.
- **Task**: Provide step-by-step instructions for completing actions.
- **Reference**: Document parameters, options, and specifications in scannable formats.
- **Troubleshooting**: Address specific problems and their solutions.

Most documentation pages combine multiple topic types.
For example, a page might start with a concept introduction, followed by task instructions, and end with troubleshooting tips.

Understanding topic types helps you organize information logically and ensures readers can find what they need quickly.

## Finding opportunities to contribute

Not sure where to start?
Here are some ways to find documentation that needs improvement:

- **Fix issues**: Check the documentation issues on GitHub for requested improvements.
- **Update existing pages**: Look for outdated information, broken links, or unclear instructions.
- **Fill gaps**: Identify features or workflows that lack documentation.
- **Improve clarity**: Simplify complex explanations or add examples to existing content.
- **Add screenshots**: Visual aids can help clarify UI-based instructions (use sparingly and follow image guidelines).
