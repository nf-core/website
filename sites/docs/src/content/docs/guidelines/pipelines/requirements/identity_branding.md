All nf-core pipelines are [community owned](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/requirements/community_owned).
At its inception, the first step was to remove institutional branding from existing workflows and migrate them to the nf-core organisation and nf-core branding.
This was done to remove institutional and organisational ownership of pipelines and code, to encourage collaboration and openness.
In this spirit, we require nf-core pipelines to be _owned_ by nf-core, and nf-core alone.

Whilst pipelines can be forked on GitHub for **personal** development work, the nf-core repository should be the primary source for all development.

Specifically:

### The nf-core repository should be set as the _head_ repo

Your personal / organisation repos should show on GitHub as being forked from nf-core, not the other way around.
This is so that it's clear where the primary development location is.
It also means that any pull-requests that are created will automatically select the nf-core repository as the target.

When new pipelines are added to nf-core, please _move_ the repository to nf-core instead of forking it.

If you have already forked your pipeline to nf-core, you can [email GitHub support](https://support.github.com/contact?subject=Reroute%20a%20Fork&tags=rr-forks) and request that they reroute the fork.

### Disable GitHub features for forks

To encourage contributors to focus on the nf-core repository, please disable GitHub issues / wiki / projects on your forked repository.
You'll find these options under the GitHub repository settings.
