All nf-core pipelines MUST come with their own Research Object (RO) Crate.
RO Crate is an open-source standard which we use to describe our pipelines and their components in a structured way and helps with automated provenance tracking.

    :::note
    The RO Crate generated with nf-core/tools describes the pipeline as a whole, not pipeline runs.
    For that kind of provenance, use the new [nf-prov plugin](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-prov), which is currently in development.
