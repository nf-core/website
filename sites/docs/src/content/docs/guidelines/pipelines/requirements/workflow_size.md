We aim to have a _"not too big, not too small"_ rule with nf-core pipelines.

This is deliberately fuzzy, but as a rule of thumb workflows should contain at least three processes and be simple enough to run that a new user can realistically run the pipeline after spending ten minutes reading the docs.

Pipelines should be general enough to be of use to multiple groups and research projects, but comprehensive enough to cover most steps in a primary analysis.
