All nf-core pipelines must be built using the nf-core template.

Workflows should be started using the `nf-core pipelines create` command which makes a new git repository and the initial commits and branches.
This is to ensure that the automated sync process that keeps all nf-core pipelines up to date can work. See the [sync docs](/docs/tutorials/sync/overview) for details.

Where possible, workflow authors should do their best to follow nf-core conventions for filenames and code locations.
