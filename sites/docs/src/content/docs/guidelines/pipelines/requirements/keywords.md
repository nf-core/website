Pipelines should have excellent documentation.

Repositories should have [GitHub Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) set on the nf-core repository.
These are then shown on the nf-core website and used for categorisation and searching.
They are important for workflow visibility and findability.

Topics can be related to the workflow, tools, data or any related aspect.
