The nf-core community was founded to allow different groups to collaborate on pipelines.
One of the strengths of this approach is that pipelines are not tied to a specific group or individual.
This means that as people's time commitments and funding change, it's possible for maintainance
of a pipeline to shift between groups and for it to stay up to date.

Please be aware that by adding a pipeline to nf-core, you are agreeing to working in our collaborative ecosystem.

- You must be willing to work with other contributors
- Decisions about the pipeline will be made based on community consensus (with final say from core team and steering if needed, see [governance](/governance))
- Other people may add features and make releases

There is no problem with the following:

- Publication of the pipeline by the primary developers
- Use and publicity of the pipeline and nf-core
