subtitle: Examples on how nf-core can be presented at events
---

The community is welcome to present various aspects of nf-core, e.g. as posters or oral presentations at conferences.

We don't have strict guidelines on how this should be done, but at a minimum acknowledging the community and a link to the nf-core website.
You're welcome to use the nf-core logo when presenting nf-core.

We would also love to know about your presentations and posters, so please let us know on the `#graphics` nf-core Slack channel!

## Posters

Examples of previously presented posters can be seen below.
Anyone is welcome to make a PR adding a PNG and PDF/SVG/Vector version to the website, and adding them to the table.
