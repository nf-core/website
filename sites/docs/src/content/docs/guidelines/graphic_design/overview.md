nf-core has a variety of recognisable images and other graphic designs for the community project.

To help facilitate the identification of nf-core pipelines and related material, we provide here a variety of files that can be used for all nf-core-related content, such as pipeline logos, presentations, or workflow diagrams.

All files are released under various forms of 'open' licenses, meaning you can re-use and re-model as you see fit.

The pages in this section provide guidance for various aspects of the nf-core graphic guidelines and other aspects of 'branding'.

This includes:

- Where to get and use the nf-core logo
- What fonts does nf-core use
- What are the nf-core colours
- How to make metro-map-like diagrams for pipeline diagrams
- Examples of various types of pipeline diagrams
- How to make a custom logo for nf-core pipelines
- Examples of how the community can present nf-core in various ways
