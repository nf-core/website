Pipeline publications and presentations (or those that describe pipelines for the first time) should give attribution to the nf-core community.

All pipeline publications and presentations should cite [The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0439-x):

> Ewels, P.A., Peltzer, A., Fillinger, S. et al. The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines. Nat Biotechnol 38, 276–278 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x

**At a minimum**, the nf-core community should be thanked in the acknowledgment section. For example, the acknowledgement from the [nf-core/clipseq](https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.19453.1)) preprint:

> We would also like to thank the nf-core team, in particular Harshil Patel, Phil Ewels and Maxime Garcia, for welcoming us to the nf-core community and their assistance in reviewing and releasing the pipeline. We would also like to thank the nf-core community for developing the nf-core infrastructure and resources for Nextflow pipelines. A full list of nf-core community members is available at https://nf-co.re/community.

**Optionally**, the nf-core community can be included as a consortium co-author. This option is preferred when a pipeline has made extensive use of existing nf-core pipeline components (e.g., modules and subworkflows) written by other community members who were not directly involved in the pipeline itself. For example, see hgtseq: [A Standard Pipeline to Study Horizontal Gene Transfer](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232314512).

If any members of the nf-core community have provided significant input to the creation of the pipeline, please consider adding them as coauthors on the paper directly.

See [Publications](https://nf-co.re/publications) for more examples of nf-core and nf-core pipeline publications.
