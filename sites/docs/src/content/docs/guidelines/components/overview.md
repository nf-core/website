nf-core aims to produce high-quality Nextflow pipelines.

An important part of this is the use of community-agreed-upon standardised components that follow 'best-practises'.

The following pages describe the specifications of standardised nf-core components:

- [Pipelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/overview)
- [Modules](/docs/guidelines/components/modules)
- [Subworkflows](/docs/guidelines/components/subworkflows)
- [Test data](/docs/guidelines/components/test_data)

These specifications can also be useful when reviewing pull requests of new or existing components, to ensure they reach nf-core standards.
