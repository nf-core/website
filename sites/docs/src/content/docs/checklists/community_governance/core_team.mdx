## New pipeline proposals and onboarding

Instructions for nf-core pipeline approval:

1. [ ] Core: Before leaving your feedback(!), add to the [proposal tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/35/views/1) under 'Under discussion'.
2. [ ] Core: Add :plus: icon on proposal to know it's on the board.
3. [ ] Community: Discuss benefits/drawbacks of the proposal.
    - Emphasise collaboration (prefer to have more developers on one pipeline rather than many developers with single developer).
    - Ensure proposal follows [nf-core pipeline guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/pipelines/overview).
    - In some cases, promote 'partial acceptance', i.e., if upstream steps already covered in another pipeline, propose new pipeline of just non-overlapping steps
4. [ ] Core: Make final decision
    - If accepted: update proposal tracking board, moving proposal to 'Accepted' section
    - If not accepted: update proposal tracking board, moving proposal to 'Turned down'
5. [ ] Core: Check proposal has received approval in #new-pipelines from either:
    - Two members of the core team.
    - One member of the core team and one member of the maintainers team.
6. [ ] Core: Verify that the pipeline name follows the [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/workflow_name).
7. [ ] Core: Create a slack channel with approved pipeline name.
8. [ ] Core: Ask the developers to join #pipeline-maintainers channel.
9. [ ] Core/Dev: Create the git repository using `nf-core pipelines create` and push it to GitHub.
10. [ ] Core/Dev: Transfer the repository to nf-core GitHub organisation and delete the repository on local the machine/user account.
11. [ ] Core/Dev: Sync the nf-co.re pipelines page by triggering the GitHub action
    - Website repo > Actions > Build json files and md-cache > Run workflow > From main.

## Uploading test data to s3 bucket

Instructions for uploading full-test AWS files for a pipeline to a S3 bucket:

1.  [ ] Check Valid test data that can be uploaded:
        :::note
        Small input data that may be unreliable when downloaded from other repositories (e.g., limit total file size to a maximum of 10 GB across all files).
        :::
2.  [ ] Check that large files that cannot be reduced or subsetted.
3.  [ ] Select **Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)** and create the pipeline directory in the S3 bucket.

## Activating Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

Instructions for setting up Zenodo DOIs.

:::note
It's recommended that a core team member transfers the DOI to the nf-core Zenodo community.
:::

Before release:

1. [ ] Sign up and log in to Zenodo.
2. [ ] Select **Settings -> GitHub -> Connect Account** and connect your GitHub account.
3. [ ] Select **Settings -> GitHub** once connected.
4. [ ] Toggle the **On** switch to enable Zenodo archiving for all nf-core pipeline repositories.
       :::note
       It's a good idea to enable this for all active pipelines, as DOIs will only be assigned upon release.
       :::

    :::note
    Some repositories (e.g., nf-core/exoseq) may not be activate as they are archived.
    :::

5. [ ] Inform the pipeline developers to make a release.

Post release:

1. [ ] Select **Settings -> Github** in Zenodo and find the relevant repository.
2. [ ] Click the Zenodo **Record** page for the release.
3. [ ] Find the **Communities** box on the record page and submit the record to the nf-core community.
4. [ ] Copy the DOI for **Cite all versions by using the DOI**.
5. [ ] Update files on the pipeline master branch:
    - `README.md`: Add the Zenodo Badge and update the **If you use this pipeline cite** section.
    - `Nextflow.config`: Update the manifest block to include the DOI.
    - Commit these changes with the message "Add Zenodo ID after first release".

## Adding new community member to the GitHub organisation

Anyone can request to join the nf-core GitHub organisation via the #github-invitations channel.
