## New pipeline proposals and onboarding

Instructions for [nf-core pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) approval:

1. [ ] Core: Before leaving your feedback(!), update the _project status_ on the issue to 'Proposed'.
2. [ ] Community: Discuss benefits/drawbacks of the proposal.
    - Emphasise collaboration (prefer to have more developers on one pipeline rather than one developer).
    - Ensure proposal follows [nf-core pipeline guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/overview).
    - In some cases, promote 'partial acceptance', i.e., if upstream steps already covered in another pipeline, propose new pipeline of just non-overlapping steps
3. [ ] Core: Make final decision
    - If accepted: update the Project status on the issue 'Accepted' section
    - If not accepted: update the project status to 'turned down'
4. [ ] Core: Check proposal has received approval in [nf-core/proposals](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) from either:
    - Two members of the core team.
    - One member of the core team and one member of the maintainers team.
5. [ ] Core: Verify that the pipeline name follows the [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/requirements/workflow_name).
6. [ ] Core: Create a slack channel with approved pipeline name.
    - [ ] Inform the new developer of the [next steps](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/adding_a_pipeline/creating_a_pipeline#create-the-pipeline)
7. [ ] Core: Add the main developers to
    - [ ] [#pipeline-maintainers](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04QR0T3G3H)
    - [ ] [#release-review-trading](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08K66XCZSL) channel.
8. [ ] Core: Create a branch with the pipeline name in the [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) repository.
9. [ ] Core/Dev: Create the git repository using `nf-core pipelines create` and push it to GitHub.
10. [ ] Core/Dev: Once first release (mostly) ready: transfer the repository to nf-core GitHub organisation and delete the repository on local the machine/user account.
11. [ ] Core/Dev: Sync the nf-co.re pipelines page by triggering the [GitHub action](https://github.com/nf-core/website/actions/workflows/build-json-files.yml)
    - Website repo > Actions > Build json files and md-cache > Run workflow > From main.

## Uploading test data to s3 bucket

Instructions for uploading full-test AWS files for a pipeline to a S3 bucket:

1.  [ ] Check if the test data is valid so that it can be uploaded:
        :::note
        Small input data that may be unreliable when downloaded from other repositories (e.g., limit total file size to a maximum of 10 GB across all files).
        :::
2.  [ ] Check that large files cannot be reduced or subsetted.
3.  [ ] Select **Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)** and create the pipeline directory in the S3 bucket.

## Activating Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

Instructions for setting up Zenodo DOIs.

:::note
It's recommended that a core team member transfers the DOI to the nf-core Zenodo community.
:::

Before release:

1.  [ ] Sign up and log in to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
2.  [ ] Select **GitHub -> Connect Account** in the dropdown menu of your account and connect your GitHub account.
3.  [ ] Select **GitHub** in the dropdown menu of your account once connected.
4.  [ ] Toggle the **On** switch of the pipeline to enable Zenodo archiving.
        :::note
        It's a good idea to enable this for all active pipelines, as DOIs will only be assigned upon release.
        :::

        :::note
        Some repositories (e.g., nf-core/exoseq) may not be activated as they are archived.
        :::

5.  [ ] Inform the pipeline developers to make a release.

Post release:

1.  [ ] Select **Github** in the dropdown menu of your account in Zenodo and find the relevant repository.
2.  [ ] Click the Zenodo **Record** page for the release.
3.  [ ] Find the **Communities** box on the record page and submit the record to the nf-core community.
4.  [ ] Copy the DOI for **Cite all versions?** in the **Versions** tab.
5.  [ ] Update files on the pipeline master branch:
    - `README.md`: Add the Zenodo Badge and update the **If you use this pipeline cite** section.
    - `Nextflow.config`: Update the manifest block to include the DOI.
    - Commit these changes with the message "Add Zenodo ID after first release".

## Adding new community member to the GitHub organisation

Anyone can request to join the nf-core GitHub organisation via the #github-invitations channel.

1.  [ ] Verify the request is reasonable (i.e., clearly not spam).
2.  [ ] Send an invitation via [nf-core github teams](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams)
3.  [ ] Add new member to the [nf-core contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams/contributors)
4.  [ ] Respond to the #github-invitations channel request by reacting with the ✅ emoji.

## Updating online bingo cards

Before each hackathon, we need to update the [bingo cards](https://nfcore-bingo.web.app/) to ensure they remain current.

To update the bingo cards:

1.  [ ] Ask for the outreach google account credentials from `@core-team`

3.  [ ] Select **nfcore-bingo**.
4.  [ ] Select **Realtime Database**.

6.  [ ] Hover over **lexicon** and select **+** to add entries:
    - Key: Number
    - Value: New board entry
7.  [ ] Select the trash bin next to the given entry to remove it.

## Backups

The following items should be regularly backed up by a member of core team with admin access to the relevant service:
