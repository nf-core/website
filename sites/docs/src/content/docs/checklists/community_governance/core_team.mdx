## New pipeline proposals and onboarding

Instructions for [nf-core pipeline](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) approval:

1. [ ] Core: Before leaving your feedback(!), update the _project status_ on the issue to 'Proposed'.
2. [ ] Community: Discuss benefits/drawbacks of the proposal.
    - Emphasise collaboration (prefer to have more developers on one pipeline rather than one developer).
    - Ensure proposal follows [nf-core pipeline guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/overview).
    - In some cases, promote 'partial acceptance', i.e., if upstream steps already covered in another pipeline, propose new pipeline of just non-overlapping steps
3. [ ] Core: Make final decision
    - If accepted: update the Project status on the issue 'Accepted' section
    - If not accepted: update the project status to 'turned down'
4. [ ] Core: Check proposal has received approval in [nf-core/proposals](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) from either:
    - Two members of the core team.
    - One member of the core team and one member of the maintainers team.
5. [ ] Core: Verify that the pipeline name follows the [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/requirements/workflow_name).
6. [ ] Core: Create a slack channel with approved pipeline name.
    - [ ] Inform the new developer of the [next steps](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/adding_a_pipeline/creating_a_pipeline#create-the-pipeline)
7. [ ] Core: Add the main developers to
    - [ ] [#pipeline-maintainers](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04QR0T3G3H)
    - [ ] [#release-review-trading](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08K66XCZSL) channel.
8. [ ] Core: Create a branch with the pipeline name in the [nf-core/test-datasets](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets) repository.
9. [ ] Core/Dev: Set up the pipeline repository:
    - If development started in a custom (non-nf-core) repo: [Transfer the repository](https://nf-co.re/docs/checklists/community_governance/core_team#repository-transfer-to-nf-core-organisation) to nf-core.
    - If starting fresh: Create a new GitHub repository with the name of the pipeline.
10. Add the pipeline name to the [website YAML file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/75a92b76129b0e2c3f644bf26482142ba9e41f6f/sites/main-site/src/config/ignored_repos.yaml) designated to ignore this repository when building the website pipeline list (until the pipeline is in advanced development or there is a need to surface it already).
11. [ ] Core/Dev: After first release, remove the pipeline name from the [website YAML file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/75a92b76129b0e2c3f644bf26482142ba9e41f6f/sites/main-site/src/config/ignored_repos.yaml) ignoring this pipeline from the build, if it is there.
12. [ ] Core/Dev: Sync the nf-co.re pipelines page by triggering the [GitHub action](https://github.com/nf-core/website/actions/workflows/build-json-files.yml)
    - Website repo > Actions > Build json files and md-cache > Run workflow > From main.

## Uploading test data to s3 bucket

Instructions for uploading full-test AWS files for a pipeline to a S3 bucket:

1.  [ ] Check if the test data is valid so that it can be uploaded:
        :::note
        Small input data that may be unreliable when downloaded from other repositories (e.g., limit total file size to a maximum of 10 GB across all files).
        :::
2.  [ ] Check that large files cannot be reduced or subsetted.
3.  [ ] Select **Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)** and create the pipeline directory in the S3 bucket.

## Repository transfer to nf-core organisation

1. [ ] Request repository ownership transfer from the developer.
    1. If the repository is under an organisation account, ask the developer to add a core team member as a co-owner.
    2. If the repository is under a personal user account, ask the developer to transfer ownership directly to a core team member’s personal account.
2. [ ] Transfer the repository to the nf-core organisation.
    1. In the repository, go to **Settings**.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of the **General** page.
    3. Select **Transfer**, next to **Transfer ownership**.
    4. Confirm or update the repository name if needed.
3. [ ] Configure repository settings in the nf-core organisation.
    1. Ask Matthias for the repository ruleset JSON files (these are still under development, but pinned in the core channel).
    2. In the repository, go to **Settings**.
    3. In the left sidebar, select Rules (under Code and automation).
    4. Select New ruleset.
    5. Select **Import a ruleset**, then select one of the JSON files.
    6. Select **Create** at the bottom of the page. Do not modify any fields.
    7. Repeat the import (step 5) and create (step 6) steps for each JSON file provided.

## Making custom docker containers for modules

Instructions for adding custom docker containers to the nf-core [https://quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/nf-core) organisation.

:::note
These instructions require the person building and pushing the container to have push rights to the organization.
**Only core members may have this access**, and new core members should request access from existing members.
:::

1. Check with the module author to ensure there is no available solution via Conda, Bioconda, or BioContainers.
2. Ask the module author to:
    - Place a `Dockerfile` alongside the module (sub)directories
    - Add a `README.md` describing why the container is needed, and provide instructions for building the container
    - (Optional) add a `.gitgnore` file to ensure build artefacts are not pushed with the `Dockerfile` and `README.md`
3. Ensure Docker is correctly authenticated for pushing to `quay.io`.

    ```bash
    docker login --username <QUAY_USER_NAME> quay.io
    ```

4. Build the Docker image locally and tag it appropriately:

    ```bash
    docker build . -t quay.io/nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>
    ```

5. Push the built container image:

    ```bash
    docker push quay.io/nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>
    ```

6. Share the container reference with the module author so they can update the module:

    ```groovy
    container "nf-core/<TOOL>:<VERSION>"
    ```

    :::note
    This replaces the entire Docker/Singularity condition in the module.

## Activating Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

Instructions for setting up Zenodo DOIs.

:::note
It's recommended that a core team member transfers the DOI to the nf-core Zenodo community.
:::

Before release:

1.  [ ] Sign up and log in to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
2.  [ ] Select **GitHub -> Connect Account** in the dropdown menu of your account and connect your GitHub account.
3.  [ ] Select **GitHub** in the dropdown menu of your account once connected.
4.  [ ] Toggle the **On** switch of the pipeline to enable Zenodo archiving.
        :::note
        It's a good idea to enable this for all active pipelines, as DOIs will only be assigned upon release.
        :::

        :::note
        Some repositories (e.g., nf-core/exoseq) may not be activated as they are archived.
        :::

5.  [ ] Inform the pipeline developers to make a release.

Post release:

1.  [ ] Select **Github** in the dropdown menu of your account in Zenodo and find the relevant repository.
2.  [ ] Click the Zenodo **Record** page for the release.
3.  [ ] Find the **Communities** box on the record page and submit the record to the nf-core community. (Google Chrome contains a graphical bug causing the **Communities** box not to show up, please use another browser if this happens to you)
4.  [ ] Copy the DOI for **Cite all versions?** in the **Versions** tab.
5.  [ ] Update files on the pipeline master branch:
    - `README.md`: Add the Zenodo Badge and update the **If you use this pipeline cite** section.
    - `Nextflow.config`: Update the manifest block to include the DOI.
    - Commit these changes with the message "Add Zenodo ID after first release".

## Adding new community member to the GitHub organisation

Anyone can request to join the nf-core GitHub organisation via the #github-invitations channel.

1.  [ ] Verify the request is reasonable (i.e., clearly not spam).
2.  [ ] Send an invitation via [nf-core github teams](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams)
3.  [ ] Add new member to the [nf-core contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams/contributors)
4.  [ ] Respond to the #github-invitations channel request by reacting with the ✅ emoji.

## Updating online bingo cards
