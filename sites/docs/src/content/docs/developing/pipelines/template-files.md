title: Pipeline file structure
subtitle: Description of the elements of an nf-core template
---

When you create a new pipeline from the nf-core template, the tool generates a complete directory structure containing numerous files and folders.
Some files serve as boilerplate that requires minimal modification, while others are essential to understand during pipeline development.

This page describes the files and directories that `nf-core pipelines create` generates when running with all template options enabled, and explains the purpose and function of each component.

## Files

You will find the following files in each nf-core pipeline.
They are automatically generated when running `nf-core pipelines create`.

| Filename                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `main.nf`                | The main Nextflow file that is executed when the pipeline runs. Typically, parameters are initialized and validated in this script before a workflow from the `workflows/` directory is called for execution.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `nextflow.config`        | The main Nextflow configuration file. It contains the default pipeline parameters, Nextflow configuration options, and information such as pipeline and minimum Nextflow version. The `nextflow.config` also defines different configuration profiles that can be used to run the pipeline. See the [Configuration docs](/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration) for more information. |
| `README.md`              | Basic information about the pipeline and usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `nextflow_schema.json`   | The JSON schema file used for pipeline parameter specification. Automatically created using the `nf-core pipelines schema build` command. It is used for printing command-line help, validating input parameters, building website documentation, and generating pipeline launch interfaces (web and CLI).                                                                                |
| `CHANGELOG.md`           | Information about the changes made to the pipeline for each release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
