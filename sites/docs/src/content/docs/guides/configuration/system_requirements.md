## Configure your system

nf-core pipelines are reproducible, portable, and scalable, and are designed to work "out of the box". However, to maximize efficiency and benefit from all of the advantages of Nextflow, it is likely you will need to configure each pipeline to suit your data and system requirements.

The following sections are common considerations for nf-core pipeline users.

All of the following options can be can be specified within a Nextflow config file.

### Executors

Nextflow pipelines will run locally by default.
Most users will need to specify an "executor" to submit jobs to a scheduler (e.g., [SGE](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#sge), [LSF](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#lsf), [SLURM](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#slurm), [AWS Batch](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#aws-batch), [Azure Batch](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#azure-batch), and [others](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#)).

A simple example of a config file specifying this could be:

    ```nextflow
    process {
        executor = 'slurm'
        queue = { task.time >= '24.d' ? 'long' : 'short' }
    }
    ```

For more complex examples, see the various institutional configs on the [nf-core/configs repository](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/conf)
See the [Nextflow executor documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html#executor-page) for more information about specific schedulers.

### Max resources

Pipeline runs occasionally fail when a process requests more resources than you have available on your system.

To avoid these failures, all nf-core pipelines [check](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/99961bedab1518f592668727a4d692c4ddf3c336/nf_core/pipeline-template/nextflow.config#L206-L237) pipeline-step resource requests against parameters called `--max_cpus`, `--max_memory` and `--max_time`. These parameters can be set as the maximum possible resources of a machine or node and act as a cap that prevents Nextflow submitting a single job requesting resources more than what is possible.

:::warning
Increasing these values from the defaults will not increase the resources available to the pipeline tasks! See [Tuning resources](#tuning-resources) for more information.
:::

Most pipelines will attempt to automatically restart jobs that fail due to lack of resources with double-requests. These `--max_<resource>` caps keep requests from getting out of hand and crashing the entire pipeline run. If a particular job exceeds the process-specific default resources and is retried, only resource requests (cpu, memory, or time) that have not yet reached the value set with `--max_<resource>` will be increased during the retry.

:::warning
The `--max_<resource>` parameters do not represent the total sum of resource usage of the pipeline at a given time - only a single pipeline job!
:::

### Tuning resources

The base config of nf-core pipelines defines the default resources allocated to each different step in the workflow (e.g., in a [`base.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/conf/base.config) file).

These values are deliberately generous due to the wide variety of workloads done by different users.
As a result, you may find that the jobs are given more resources than they need and your system is not used efficiently.
At the other end of the scale, you may want to increase the resources given to a specific task to make it run faster.
You may wish to increase resources if you get a pipeline reporting a step failing with an `Command exit status`, such as `137`.

:::warning
You should not modify the `base.config` of the pipeline! But always modify resource requests in your own custom or institutioanl config file!
:::

Where possible, pipeline steps are tuned to make use of the resources available.
For example, if a tool allows specification of the number of CPUs or threads to use with the parameter (e.g., `-p`), nf-core pipeline modules will use this parameter when executing the tool, with the number of CPUs being derived from either the `base.config` or your own custom config file.

By default, process resources are inherited by a label. For example:

```groovy
process {
  withLabel:process_low {
    cpus = { check_max( 2 * task.attempt, 'cpus' ) }
    memory = { check_max( 14.GB * task.attempt, 'memory' ) }
    time = { check_max( 6.h * task.attempt, 'time' ) }
  }
  withLabel:process_medium {
    cpus = { check_max( 6 * task.attempt, 'cpus' ) }
    memory = { check_max( 42.GB * task.attempt, 'memory' ) }
    time = { check_max( 8.h * task.attempt, 'time' ) }
  }
  withLabel:process_high {
    cpus = { check_max( 12 * task.attempt, 'cpus' ) }
    memory = { check_max( 84.GB * task.attempt, 'memory' ) }
    time = { check_max( 10.h * task.attempt, 'time' ) }
  }
}
```

A default [`check_max()`](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/99961bedab1518f592668727a4d692c4ddf3c336/nf_core/pipeline-template/nextflow.config#L206-L237) function will apply the thresholds set in `--max_cpus`, `--max_memory` and `--max_time` (or `params.max_cpus` etc. in a config file).
The `* task.attempt` means that these values are doubled and automatically retried after failing with an exit code that corresponds to a lack of resources.

:::warning
If you want to use the `check_max()` function in a custom configuration file, you must copy the [check_max function](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/99961bedab1518f592668727a4d692c4ddf3c336/nf_core/pipeline-template/nextflow.config#L206-L237) to the bottom of your custom config
:::

Selectors can be used to fine file specific parts of an nf-core pipeline.

To modify the memory to **all processes with a specific label** you can use the `withLabel` process selector. For example:

```groovy
process {
  withLabel:process_high {
    memory = 200.GB
  }
}
```

This example would modify the memory for all processes with the `process_high` label.

To modify the memory to **specific processes** you can use the `withName` process selector. For example:

```groovy
process {
  withName: STAR_ALIGN {
    memory = 200.GB
  }
}
```

This example would modify the memory of the `STAR_ALIGN` process.

If a pipeline uses a tool multiple times you may need to specify the whole 'execution path' of the module. For example:

```groovy
process {
    withName: 'NFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN' {
        memory = 100.GB
    }
}
```

See the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#process-selectors) for more information about process selectors.

:::note
If you think that the default resources for a pipeline are drastically too high or low please contact the developers of the given pipeline know either on Slack in the channel for the pipeline or via a GitHub issue on the pipeline repository.
:::

:::warning
Be careful with your syntax - if you set the memory to be `200` then it will get 200 _bytes_ of memory. <br/>
Memory should be in quotes with a space or without quotes using a dot: `"200 GB"` or `200.GB`. <br/>
See the Nextflow docs for [memory](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#memory),
[cpus](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#cpus) (int) and
[time](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#time) for more information.
