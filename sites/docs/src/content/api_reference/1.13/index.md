# Welcome to nf-core tools API documentation!

This documentation is for the `nf-core/tools` package.

Primarily, it describes the different [code lint tests](lint_tests/index.html)
run by `nf-core lint` (typically visited by a developer when their pipeline fails a given
test), and also reference for the `nf_core` [Python package API](index).
