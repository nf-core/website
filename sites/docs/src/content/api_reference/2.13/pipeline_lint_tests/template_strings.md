# template_strings

#### `PipelineLint.template_strings(){:python}`

Check for template placeholders.

The `nf-core create` pipeline template uses
[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) behind the scenes.

This lint test fails if any Jinja template variables such as
`{{ pipeline_name }}` are found in your pipeline code.

Finding a placeholder like this means that something was probably copied and pasted
from the template without being properly rendered for your pipeline.

This test ignores any double-brackets prefixed with a dollar sign, such as
`${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}` as these placeholders are used in GitHub Actions workflows.

:::note
You can choose to ignore lint test tests by editing the file called
`.nf-core.yml` in the root of your pipeline and setting the test to false:

```yaml
lint:
  template_strings: False
```

:::

To disable this test only for specific files, you can specify a list of file paths to ignore.
For example, to ignore a pdf you added to the docs:

```yaml
lint:
  template_strings:
    - docs/my_pdf.pdf
```
