# Meeting schedule

We have a monthly online meeting every 2nd Thursday of the month at 15:00 (Berlin time)

We meet online either on:

- gather.town (when less than 10 people)
- Zoom (more than 10 people)

The location is normally decided by vote on the day prior the vote on the nf-core slack.

To get the joining links, or added to a Google Calendar event, please ask on the [#meta-omics](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C070369GP7T) channel on the nf-core slack.
