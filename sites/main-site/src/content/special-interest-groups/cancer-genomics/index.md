# Introduction

The Cancer Genomics special interest group is aimed at anybody in the cancer genomics field using Nextflow and/or nf-core pipelines to ultimately improve the outcome for patients! Regardless of which of the existing nf-core pipeline that you are using, the main focus will be to discuss the different challenges faced by users and developpers in the field, how they handle them and what solutions could we come up with for them, be it in the shape of pipelines or modules, while adhering to best practices.

# Activities

Activities will involve monthly (or bi-monthly) meetings with pre-selected topics and a presentation for an in-depth discussion. Suggestions and feedback are welcome for anyone and everyone!

# How to join

Join the [nf-core Slack](/join#slack) and find us in the [#cancer-genomics](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08GSRYDTV2) channel
