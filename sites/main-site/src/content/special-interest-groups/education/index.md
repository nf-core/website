# Introduction

This interest group aims at promoting the inclusion of Nextflow into academic curricula, developing open-source educational materials, and fostering best practices in teaching and assessment involving Nextflow and nf-core.

# Objectives and Activities

- Develop and share open-source educational resources to integrate Nextflow into higher education curricula across various disciplines.
- Identify and implement best practices in teaching and assessment involving Nextflow, grounded in recognised pedagogical frameworks such as constructive alignment.
- Create application-specific teaching materials focused on nf-core pipelines to ensure instruction is relevant and practical.
- Identify and promote best practices for data simulation, aimed at designing problem-based educational experiences that benefit of narrative-driven data scenarios.
- Build a community of Nextflow users involved in education to facilitate the exchange of ideas, resources, experiences, and create opportunities for networking and collaboration.
- Identify and pursue opportunities for grant applications and funding dedicated to advancing Nextflow and bioinformatics education initiatives.

Initial activities will involve a monthly meeting with developers and users, to identify priorities and most important needs, as well as draw an action plan. Future activities may include presentations and discussions from topic-experts, as well as tutorials, workshops, and demo-days of nf-core pipelines to run tutorials developed within this group.
