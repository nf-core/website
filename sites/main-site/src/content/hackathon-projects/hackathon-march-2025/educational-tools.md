This project focuses on generating additional data, materials and automated tools to support bioinformatics education, and the use of Nextflow in academic curricula.

## Goals

- **Creating a pipeline to simulate educational datasets**
  - _This is for contributors with experience in nf-core module structure and dependencies, and ideally with experience in teaching bioinformatics at different levels. The purpose of the pipeline is to generate what we call "storyline-based data", i.e. datasets which can follow a storyline and with a specific biological meaning to be identified when used for bioinformatics education._

- **Translation of tutorials**
  - _For users who would like to contribute by translating existing tutorials in a language different than English._

- **Domain specific tutorials**
  - _For users with experience using nf-core pipelines to analyse specific datasets, and who would like to contribute by identifying the appropriate simulated datasets, and creating a tutorial to guide new users in specific applications of a pipeline._

_We welcome contributors of all experience levels, particularly in creating documentation and reviewing existing one._
