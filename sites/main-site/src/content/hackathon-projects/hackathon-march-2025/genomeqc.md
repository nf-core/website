## Project aim

We would like to expand [nf-core/genomeqc](https://github.com/nf-core/genomeqc) with new tools and functionalities. Your ideas are very welcome!

Suggestions about documentation, code readability, or anything you can think of are also appreciated.

## Goals

- **Add FCS decontamination subworkflow**:
  - Merge decontamination [PR](https://github.com/nf-core/genomeqc/pull/72).
- **Update template for nf-core/tools v3.2.0**:
  - Merge update [PR](https://github.com/nf-core/genomeqc/pull/110).
- **Expand nf-core/genomeqc** with new modules and workflows.
