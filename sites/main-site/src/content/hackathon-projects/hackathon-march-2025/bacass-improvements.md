This project aims to improve and optimize the [nf-core/bacass](https://nf-co.re/bacass/dev) pipeline by enhancing assembly strategies and exploring new analysis steps.

We will focus on:

1. **Benchmarking and testing** new tools to improve genome assembly strategies.
2. **Focusing on long-read and hybrid assembly** approaches to enhance the quality of results.
3. **Identifying additional improvements** discussed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/nf-core/bacass/issues/57).

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Goal

1. Optimize assembly strategies by integrating and testing new tools.
2. Improve support for long-read and hybrid genome assembly.
3. Explore additional enhancements based on community discussions.
