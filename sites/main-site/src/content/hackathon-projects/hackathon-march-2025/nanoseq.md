This project aims to make improvements to the existing nanoseq pipeline.

## Goals

1. Improve existing nanoseq modules
2. Use nf-core modules where possible
3. Get pipeline to pass linting
4. Implement other nanoseq functionality that has yet to be added

## Motivation

Many of us are Clinical Bioinformaticians and would like to see if we can improve and update nanoseq for potential clincal use with nanopore.
