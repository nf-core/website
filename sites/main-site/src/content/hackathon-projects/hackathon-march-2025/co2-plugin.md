# nf-co2footprint plugin project

## Resources

- [Website](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-co2footprint/)
- [Github](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint)
- [Slack](https://nextflow.slack.com/archives/C060UBAQ5QF)

## Summary

Help us to solve problems we encountered during the path to the first release of a CO2 estimation plugin for Nextflow runs.

## Goals

- Address open issues in of the current plugin development process
- Brainstorm for potential features

## Tasks

- Add information on potential CO2 footprint optimization
  - [Issue](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint/issues/110)
- Accumulate CO2 Emission of several runs from cache
  - [Issue](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint/issues/62)
  - One value for included cached footprint, one for real execution value
- `cpu_model` comparison to vendor info
  - [Issue](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint/issues/61)
