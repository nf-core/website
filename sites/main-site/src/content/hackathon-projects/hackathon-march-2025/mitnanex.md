## Introduction

[MITNANEX](https://github.com/juanjo255/MITNANEX/tree/main) is a pipeline designed for **mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation from Nanopore sequencing data**. It aims to provide a streamlined workflow for processing long-read mitochondrial sequencing data, from raw reads to a fully annotated mitochondrial genome.

By joining this group, you can:

1. Create a Docker container for all tools needed in the pipeline.
2. Automate the current pipeline in Nextflow to improve scalability and reproducibility.
3. Enhance documentation and usability to make the pipeline more accessible

This project is exclusively for onsite participants working in Medell√≠n, Colombia.

## Goal

- Work towards a **first functional release** with automated mitochondrial genome assembly, polishing, and annotation.
- **Refactor the pipeline** to follow **nf-core best practices**, ensuring modularity, scalability, and reproducibility.
- **Bonus** Develop an nf-core config for seamless integration with any Nextflow pipeline, allowing -profile <name-of-infra> to work out of the box.
