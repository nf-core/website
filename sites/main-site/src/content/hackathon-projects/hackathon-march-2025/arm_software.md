Looking into making more packages build natively for `linux/arm64` and improving performance of the important ones for faster and cheaper runs on ARM machines such as AWS Graviton.

Also - feel free to join if you would like any help in deploying and testing `linux/arm64` software on your favourite pipelines, or performance and cost benchmarking!

See [current progress](https://github.com/ewels/nf-core-arm-discovery)
and [project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/89).

## Goal

Optimise run time on at least one tool
