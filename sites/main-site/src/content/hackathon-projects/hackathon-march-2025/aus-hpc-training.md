We are developing a Nextflow for HPC training for Australia's national supercomputers, [NCI's Gadi HPC](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems) and [Pawsey's Setonix HPC](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/setonix/). The training will be delivered in 2025 by the [Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) and partners. We intend to develop a hands-on workshop providing attendees with practical skills in configuring, optimising, and troubleshooting Nextflow pipelines on HPC systems. It will cover essential HPC job scheduling concepts, best practices for resource allocation, and efficient software environment management. This workshop will be extensible to other HPC systems, but initially will focus on targeting PBSPro and SLURM schedulers.

## Goals

- Plan workshop structure and delivery mechanism
- Identify basic and advanced topics to be covered in workshop
- Develop learning objectives and lesson plan
- Note contributors and their roles in the workshop

_We welcome contributors who have experience working on these systems and an interest in developing and delivering this training at their institution._
