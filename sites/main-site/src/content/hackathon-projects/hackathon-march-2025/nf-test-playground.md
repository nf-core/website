Some of us develop and maintain Nextflow pipelines that require ongoing maintenance. As these pipelines get updated, itâ€™s crucial to ensure they continue working as intended.

We are running an nf-test working group during the hackathon where we collaborate on writing and applying unit tests to existing institutional pipelines.

## Goals

- Explore the nf-test documentation and guides
- Identify and share minimal test datasets
- Apply and share tips for writing effective unit tests (Arrange, Act, Assert)

This is an opportunity to contribute to open-source Nextflow pipelines developed by Australian institutions while improving pipeline reliability and best practices.

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.
