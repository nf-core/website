This project aims to develop and enhance the [PikaVirus](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/PikaVirus) pipeline for viral metagenomics.

We encourage both newcomers and experienced Nextflow developers to join!

## Goal

1. Identify and resolve existing challenges within the `PikaVirus` pipeline.
2. Conduct rigorous benchmarking and testing to enhance pipeline robustness and efficiency.
3. Improve documentation to enhance usability and accessibility for the broader community.
