nf-core/clipseq has been inching towards a very massive feature-packed 2.0.0 release on the [feat-2-0 branch](https://github.com/nf-core/clipseq/tree/feat-2-0).
This would be a great opportunity to start crossing off tasks to get us over that sweet, sweet nf-core release line!

Tasks include:

- updating to the latest template,
- adding tests,
- improving documentation
- pipeline tube map

## Goal

Work towards a dazzling 2.0 release.
