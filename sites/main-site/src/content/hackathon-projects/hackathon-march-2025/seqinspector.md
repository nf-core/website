nf-core/seqinspector aims to be a pipeline for initial quality control of sequencing data. Input is either FASTQ files or a run folder, and output is planned to be a global MultiQC report and, if wished, MultiQC files of groups that are defined in the sample sheet. By joining this group you can

1. Add existing modules to a pipeline (beginner friendly)
2. Start with implementation of long read methods (advanced level, we have only limited experience in the group, so help would be more than appreciated!).
3. Work on display of the data in the MultiQC reports (beginner - intermediate level)
4. Write documentation

## Goal

Work towards a first release.
