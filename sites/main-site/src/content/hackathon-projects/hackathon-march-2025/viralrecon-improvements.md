This project aims to enhance and optimize the [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/dev) pipeline by addressing key issues and improving functionality, with a focus on the [2.7 milestone](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/milestone/5).

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Goal

1. Resolve codon merging issues to enhance sequence processing accuracy.
2. Improve Nanopore data analysis for better long-read handling.
3. Optimize MultiQC reporting to provide clearer and more comprehensive pipeline metrics.
