This project aims to update and optimize the [nf-core/bactmap](https://nf-co.re/bactmap/1.0.0/) pipeline as the last update to the pipeline was June 2021.

We will focus on:

1. **Update to current nf-core template:** current template is very out of date.
2. **Update modules to current versions:** many of the tools are old versions.
3. **Potentially incorporating long read mapping as an option:** would improve pipeline if ONT and PacBio could also be mapped
4. **Update documentation:** update documentation to reflect updates and improvements to pipeline
5. **Identifying additional improvements:** as discussed in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nf-core/bactmap/issues).

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Goals

1. Update pipeline to current nf-core template and standards (intermediate experience).
2. Update all modules (beginner experience)
3. Add support for long-read mapping (intermediate experience).
4. Update documentation (beginner experience)
5. Explore additional enhancements based on community discussions (intermediate experience).
