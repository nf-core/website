This project focuses on integrating [arcasHLA](https://github.com/RabadanLab/arcasHLA) into the [nf-core/airrflow](https://nf-co.re/airrflow) pipeline to enable HLA typing. 
With this addition, the pipeline will offer expanded support for immune repertoire studies, providing researchers with more comprehensive analysis capabilities in immunogenomics.


## Goals

- **Adding arcasHLA to nf-core/airrflow as a new module.**
  - _For people interested in Nextflow module development and immune repertoire analysis._
- **Ensuring smooth integration with existing pipeline components.**
  - _For contributors with experience in nf-core module structure and dependencies._
- **Validating and benchmarking the implementation for accuracy and efficiency.**
  - _For users experienced with HLA typing and workflow validation._

_We welcome contributors of all experience levels._
