This project focuses on creating bioimage data processing modules based on [OME](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/) tools and [standards](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/citing-ome/).
These modules aim to provide initial support for large scale bioimage processing with [OME-NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/).

## Goals

- **Adding a new module for the [bioformats2raw tool](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw). See [Bioformats](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201004104), [OME-Zarr](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00418-023-02209-1)**
- **Adding a new module for the [raw2ometiff tool](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/raw2ometiff). See [OME-TIFF](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23937-4_1)**
- **Adding a new module for data transfer with [OMERO](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1896) (based on [omero-py](https://github.com/ome/omero-py))**

_We welcome contributors of all experience levels._
