This project aims to enhance the [nf-core/ampliseq](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/dev) pipeline to support plant metabarcoding analyses.
By expanding the reference database, we will improve its functionality, fostering broader adoption and making plant metabarcoding more accessible to the scientific community.

## Goals

- **Expanding the reference sequences for plant metabarcoding analyses.**
  - _For people who enjoy working with Nextflow and are interested in plant metabarcoding._
- **Integrating the new references following the latest nf-core and Nextflow standards.**
  - _For people with some experience in (nf-core) workflow development._
- **Benchmarking and validating the pipeline to ensure error-free performance.**
  - _For people with some experience in using Nextflow/nf-core pipelines._
- **Improving documentation and user support to promote broader adoption.**
  - _For first-time contributors interested in making the pipeline more accessible!_

_We welcome contributors of all experience levels._
