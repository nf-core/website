The **NF-PCGR** (Nextflow-based Pipeline for Clinical Genome Reports) is an open-source pipeline for generating clinical genome reports using the PCGR framework.
During this hackathon, we aim to update the functionality of NF-PCGR and try to complete the integration with sarek.

## Goal

By the end of the hackathon, we aim to achieve the following:

- Integrate new variant annotation sources to improve reporting.
- Optimize pipeline execution for better performance.
- Start the integration with nf-core sarek

## How to Get Involved

If you're interested in contributing, check out the [NF-PCGR repository](https://github.com/BarryDigby/nf-pcgr) for existing issues and ideas.
Feel free to join our Slack discussions and submit pull requests!

Let's collaborate to improve NF-PCGR and make it a powerful tool for clinical genomics!
