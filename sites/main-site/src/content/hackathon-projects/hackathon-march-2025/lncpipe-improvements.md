This project aims to build upon and update the [nf-core/lncpipe](https://github.com/nf-core/lncpipe) pipeline, originally designed for the analysis of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
While development has slowed down, we aim to modernize the pipeline and bring it to the current nf-core and Nextflow pipeline standards, improve its usability, and demonstrate its relevance for the scientific community.

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Goals

1. **Expand documentation and user support to encourage wider adoption.**

   _A great entry point for first-time contributors—help make the pipeline more accessible!_

2. **Update the pipeline to the latest nf-core and Nextflow standards.**

   _Perfect for those who enjoy working with Nextflow and want to contribute to pipeline modernization._

3. **Improve compatibility with current reference genome annotations and transcriptomic datasets.**

   _A great challenge for contributors familiar with RNA-seq data and bioinformatics workflows._

4. **Optimize integration with existing RNA-seq pipelines for seamless lncRNA analysis.**

   _Ideal for those with some experience in workflow development and RNA sequencing analysis._

Join us in improving lncpipe and making lncRNA analysis more accessible!
