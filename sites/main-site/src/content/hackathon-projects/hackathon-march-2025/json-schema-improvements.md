This group will focus on improving and optimizing the JSON schemas available in nf-core pipelines. Lots of JSON schemas lack keywords that could massively improve the validation of the pipeline input. The error messages are also very confusing and incomplete in most cases.

Everyone is welcome from absolute beginners to seasoned Nextflow/nf-core users.

We will also start migrating the last pipelines that are still using nf-validation to nf-schema as a secondary goal.

## Goal

1. Improve and optimize JSON schemas in nf-core pipelines
2. (Optionally) Migrate more pipelines from nf-validation to nf-schema
