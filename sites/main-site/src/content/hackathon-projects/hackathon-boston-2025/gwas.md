## Project aim

We are planning on taking over the GWAS project that was already proposed as a new nf-core pipeline, but that was never started.

The project will focus on creating a framework for Genome Wide Association Studies.

Every help is welcome.

## Goals

- **Establishing ideas**
  - We would like to establish the best tools that people need for their work. We will do an open discussion to choose all the features that may be needed.
- **Build missing modules.**
  - Most tools are not present in nf-core. Check the [samplesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1snEbtzyogTF4fM2gFnxUGUFZsQCHhvb3vOAGBmciFzU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for tool ideas.
- **Test data.**
  - Identify data for use in unit tests.
- **Buidling the pipeline.**
  - We aim to build with basic pipeline to deal with SNPs and univariate tratis. We will expand on this in the future.
