Contribute to the final push for releasing V2 of the nf-core documentation with quality control, link fixes, and content refinement.

## Goal

Work towards completing the final quality control phase of the nf-core documentation v2 release, fixing links, filling content gaps, and helping the documentation meet our new standards.

## Description

James and Chris have almost completed the migration of existing documentation into the new styled documentation set.
Content has been migrated with the newly developed style guide applied and restructured to make finding information more intuitive.

This project focuses on the critical quality control phase:

- Fixing broken or outdated links throughout the documentation
- Identifying and filling content gaps discovered during migration
- Reviewing migrated content for clarity and consistency
- Validating that the new structure works effectively
- Polishing documentation to meet the new quality standards
- Creating new content where opportunities are identified

With the rapid initial migration complete, we need careful review and refinement to help make the v2 documentation launch as successful as possible and improve the user experience.
