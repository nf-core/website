## Project Aim

Working on your favourite pipeline?

Need an excuse (or don't know where) to start making nf-test snapshots for pipelines?

Let's do it together!

We will sit around a table and work on writing comprehensive and robust nf-test assertions for pipeline-level tests.
By sitting together we hope that we can find common solutions to 'tricky' unstable files that are not captured by standard nf-test assertions.
We can also share tips and tricks for structuring nf-test test files, as well as running the tests themselves.

## Goals

1. Learn how to use nf-test at a pipeline level (beginner)
2. Hive-mind common solutions on how to snapshot weird and wonderful unstable files (intermediate/expert)
3. Make your pipelines CI testing more extensive and robust :muscle: (intermediate)
