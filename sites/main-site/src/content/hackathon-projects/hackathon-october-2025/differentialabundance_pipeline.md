## Project Aim

The [nf-core/differentialabundance](https://github.com/nf-core/differentialabundance) pipeline is designed for running differential abundance analysis.

Major changes are currently in progress to transform this pipeline into a “hub” pipeline that makes it easy to try out and compare different analysis methods in one place.

We want to use the hackathon to brainstorm/develop/implement/improve the ideas that drive this transition forward, explore any other feature that could make this pipeline more useful, and update the documentation.

Please join us if you are interested in this transformation or simply on the task of differential abundance itself!

## Goals

Differential abundance analysis, hub pipelines, documentation and more!
