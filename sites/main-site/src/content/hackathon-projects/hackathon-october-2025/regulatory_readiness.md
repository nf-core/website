## Project Aim

We propose enhancing the nf-core/stats page to include richer, more actionable information that supports the generation of regulatory readiness documents. This will incorporate several metrics outlined in this issue and extend functionality by developing a proof-of-concept tool for creating accompanying reports for nf-core pipelines. Ultimately, this solution can be integrated into official tooling, aligning with initiatives previously explored by the #regulatory-sig.

## Goals

- Enhance the stats page: Expand the current page to include comprehensive metrics required for regulatory readiness. [Level: Beginner to Expert, depending on metrics needed]
- Develop proof-of-concept tooling: Create a prototype that generates pipeline-specific reports from available metrics. [Level: Expert]
- Pilot implementation: Apply the tooling to 1â€“2 selected pipelines to validate feasibility and effectiveness. [Level: Expert]
