nf-core/sammyseq is designed for the analysis of a novel NGS application to analyze the chromatin state on different levels.
This project aims at completing the missing bits to release the 1.0 version by enforcing the nf-core standards and guidelines
compliance and completing the novel analysis paths with the Hi-C-like analysis of compartments described in [Lucini et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae454)

## Goals

1. Complete compartment analysis subworkflow and components ​(expert)
2. ⁠First release checklist fulfillment ​(medium with core help)
3. Improve output for visualization and reports ​(medium)
4. ⁠Improve flexibility by adding skip options and additional input types ​(medium, expert)
5. Update documentation and easy tasks (beginner)
