## Project Aim

The [nf-core/variantprioritization](https://github.com/nf-core/variantprioritization) pipeline is in a very mature dev state. We want to take the hackathon energy and go towards release 1.0.0.

Project tasks include testing the pipeline, writing nf-tests, adding more documentation, collecting ideas for future features and everything else that might have to do with variantprioritization.

We are looking for people who work with variant calling and reporting for feedback and ideas! But anyone who is interested is welcome to join.

## Goals

- prepare release 1.0.0
- collect more issues with ideas for future features
