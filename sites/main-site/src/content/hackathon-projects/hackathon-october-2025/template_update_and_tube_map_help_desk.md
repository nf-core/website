## Project Aim

A new template update just came out before the hackathon (hopefully), coming with the usual obstacles of integrating them into the `dev` branch.
In this group we will work on helping you go through the template update, review them and celebrate the merge.

What is the best thing to do at a hackathon: procrastination!
And there is not better procrastination in nf-core than making and polishing a pipeline tube map.
If you want to start one for your pipeline and want to get some help on how to do it or get an "expert-review" review of your current one, this is your place. Crayons included.

:::warning
This group will not work on automating the process of creating a tube map.
Doing them manually is part of the process.
