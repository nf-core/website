## Project Aim

In this project we will focus on getting the topics channel support added to nf-core tools and nf-core modules (see [PR](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/3779/) for supporting it in the tools repo). 

When this release has become more widely available, we will start working on migrating the more popular modules to this new structure.

Additionaly, we will also update the nf-core guidelines to make topic channels required for all version outputs in modules.

## Goals (with recommended experience levels)

- Do a release of nf-core/tools with the new topic channels structure
- Update popular modules to work with topic channels for their versions output
- Update the guidelines to state that versions output should be using topics
