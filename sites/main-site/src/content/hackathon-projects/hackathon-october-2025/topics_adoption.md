## Project Aim

In this project we will focus on getting the topics channel PR (https://github.com/nf-core/tools/pull/3779/) merged into the `dev` branch and do a small release of the nf-core tooling. This will require updates to a couple of modules to make sure all tests pass.

When this release has happened, we will start working on migrating the more popular modules to this new structure.

Additionaly, we will also update the nf-core guidelines to make topic channels required for all version outputs in modules.

## Goals (with recommended experience levels)

- Do a release of nf-core/tools with the new topic channels structure (medium, expert)
- Update popular modules to work with topic channels for their versions output (beginner)
- Update the guidelines to state that versions output should be using topics (beginner, medium)
