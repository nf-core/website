## Project Aim

The aim is to address some open issues (or at least lay out a detailed description of how to address them), see the Goals section below.

The overal goals are to improve the workflow and move it again closer to be fully compatible with nf-core.

:::warning
This group will work on a pipeline that is currently not developed actively
within nf-core, but aligned to the nf-core tools template.

## Goals (with recommended experience levels)

See the issue with the link below here:

- [ ] Check linting errors [https://github.com/bigbio/quantms/issues/593](bigbio/quantms/593) (beginner, medium)
- [ ] Update schema and make it compatible with seqera’s interface [https://github.com/bigbio/quantms/pull/590](bigbio/quantms/590) (beginner, medium)
- [ ] Find parameter which were actually used, see issue [https://github.com/bigbio/quantms/issues/591](bigbio/quantms/591) (expert)
- [ ] Add protein quantification, see issue [https://github.com/bigbio/quantms/issues/592](bigbio/quantms/592) (medium, expert)
