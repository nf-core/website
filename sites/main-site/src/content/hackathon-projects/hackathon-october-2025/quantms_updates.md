## Project Aim

The aim is to address some open issues (or at least lay out a detailed description of how to address them), see the Goals section below.

The overal goals are to improve the workflow and move it again closer to be fully compatible with nf-core.

:::warning
This group will work on a pipeline that is currently not developed actively 
within nf-core, but aligned to the nf-core tools template.
