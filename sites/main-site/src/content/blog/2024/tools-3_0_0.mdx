# What and Why?

The nf-core/tools CLI is the backbone of our community.
It encapsulates the pipeline template that we use and packages and simplifies the tasks involved in keeping nf-core pipelines up to date.
The same holds true for modules and subworkflows.
In many ways, it is the linchpin of our collaborative coding.

This week, we are thrilled to announce nf-core/tools version 3.0.0.
With this release we bring much-requested template granularity, better findability for the many commands, and a suite of major updates to the nf-core pipeline template.
This blog post explains what's new and guides you through the update process.

We promise, it's worth it! :pray:

## ‚ú® New features

-   Enhanced pipeline template customisation
    -   The template has been divided into features that can be selectively included or excluded.
        For example, you can now create a new pipeline without any traces of FastQC.
    -   You can strip down the pipeline to the bare minimum and add only the tools you need.
    -   For nf-core pipelines, certain core features (e.g., documentation, CI tests) remain mandatory, but you still have significant customisation flexibility.
-   New Text User Interface (TUI) for pipeline creation
    -   A guided interface helps you through the process when running `nf-core pipelines create{:bash}` (don't worry - you can still use the CLI by providing all values as parameters).
        {" "}
        <YouTube id={"VwjXNXONHlY"} poster={`https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VwjXNXONHlY/maxresdefault.jpg`} />
-   Switch to [nf-schema](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/latest/) for input validation
    -   Replaces its predecessor nf-validation as a standard plugin in the template
-   CI tests now use the nf-core tools version matching the pipeline's template version
    -   This will reduce errors in opened PRs with each new tools release

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Breaking changes

-   All pipeline commands now require the `pipelines` prefix.
    This change makes the commands more consistent with `nf-core modules{:bash}` and `nf-core subworkflows{:bash}` commands.
    The commands which changed are:

    | old command                         | new command                                   |
    | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | `nf-core lint{:bash}`               | `nf-core pipelines lint{:bash}`               |
    | `nf-core launch{:bash}`             | `nf-core pipelines launch{:bash}`             |
    | `nf-core download{:bash}`           | `nf-core pipelines download{:bash}`           |
    | `nf-core create-params-file{:bash}` | `nf-core pipelines create-params-file{:bash}` |
    | `nf-core create{:bash}`             | `nf-core pipelines create{:bash}`             |
    | `nf-core lint{:bash}`               | `nf-core pipelines lint{:bash}`               |
    | `nf-core bump-version{:bash}`       | `nf-core pipelines bump-version{:bash}`       |
    | `nf-core sync{:bash}`               | `nf-core pipelines sync{:bash}`               |
    | `nf-core schema build{:bash}`       | `nf-core pipelines schema build{:bash}`       |
    | `nf-core schema docs{:bash}`        | `nf-core pipelines schema docs{:bash}`        |
    | `nf-core schema lint{:bash}`        | `nf-core pipelines schema lint{:bash}`        |
    | `nf-core schema validate{:bash}`    | `nf-core pipelines schema validate{:bash}`    |
    | `nf-core create-logo{:bash}`        | `nf-core pipelines create-logo{:bash}`        |

-   Some options have been changed for the `nf-core pipelines download{:bash}` command:
    -   The `-t` / `--tower` flag has been renamed to `-p` / `--platform`.
    -   We renamed the short flags for consistency, to always use the first letter of the second word in the long flag:
        -   The `-d` / `--download-configuration` flag has been renamed to `-c` / `--download-configuration`.
        -   The `-p` / `--parallel-downloads` flag has been renamed to `-d` / `--parallel-downloads`.

## ü´° Deprecations

-   The `nf-core licences{:bash}` command is deprecated.
-   Python 3.8 reaches end of life in October 2024, so this will probably be the last release supporting Python 3.8.

# Tip: Avoiding Merge Conflicts

The v3 release of nf-core/tools includes the ability to have fine-grained control of which template features to include.
You can use this new functionality to switch off chunks of the template.
Doing so means less code will update in the template, and fewer merge conflicts in files that you don't care about.

So - if you don't use any of these template features:

-   fastqc
-   multiqc
-   igenomes
-   nf_schema

you can minimize merge conflicts with a quick update and intermediate sync:

1. Start by checking out the `dev` branch:

```bash
git switch dev
```

2. Update the template to the latest version:

```bash
nf-core pipelines sync
```

3. Pull the updated `.nf-core.yml` file from the TEMPLATE branch:

```bash
git checkout TEMPLATE -- .nf-core.yml
```

4. Add the features you want to skip to `skip_features`:

```yaml title=".nf-core.yml"
template:
    skip_features:
        - fastqc
        - igenomes
        - nf_schema
```

5. Commit the changes:

```bash
git add .nf-core.yml
git commit -m "Skip fastqc, igenomes and nf_schema"
```

6. Add the changes to the `dev` branch:

```bash
git push origin dev
```

7. Merge the changes into the `dev` branch of the nf-core repository:
8. Retrigger the pipeline sync via the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/actions/workflows/sync.yml) using the name of your pipeline as the input.
9. Your template update merge should now have fewer conflicts! üéâ

# Important Template Updates

## The `check_max()` Function Has Been Removed

The `check_max()` function has been replaced by core Nextflow functionality called [`resourceLimits`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#resourcelimits).

The `resourceLimits` are specified in the `nextflow.config` file. You can remove all references to `check_max()` and its associated parameters (`max_cpus`, `max_memory`, and `max_time`).
For more information, see the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#resourcelimits).

## The nf-validation Plugin Has Been Replaced by nf-schema

The `nf-validation` plugin is deprecated in favour of the new `nf-schema` plugin.

This plugin uses a new JSON schema draft (2020-12), requiring changes to the `nextflow_schema.json` and `assets/schema_input.json` files. Follow the [migration guide](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/2.0/migration_guide/) for required changes.

The following validation parameters have been removed from `nextflow.config` and `nextflow_schema.json`:

-   `validationFailUnrecognisedParams`
-   `validationLenientMode`
-   `validationSchemaIgnoreParams`
-   `validationShowHiddenParams`
-   `validate_params`

Instead, use the `validation` scope for `nf-schema` options.

:::note
The plugins definition and `validation` scope have been moved further down `nextflow.config` and are now found after the `manifest` scope. This allows access to `manifest` variables to help improve message customisation.
:::

The `UTILS_NFVALIDATION_PLUGIN` subworkflow has been replaced by `UTILS_NFSCHEMA_PLUGIN`, changing how the input samplesheet is read. See [the documentation](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/2.0/migration_guide/#__tabbed_2_2) for details on using the new `samplesheetToList()` function.

# Removing scripting from `nextflow.config`

To prepare for upcoming Nextflow syntax depreciations, for loops and try/catch blocks have been removed from the template config files:

-   nf-core configs are now included without try/catch blocks
-   Include statements have been moved after profile definitions to ensure correct profile overriding
-   For more information, see these Nextflow issues: [#1792](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1792) and [#5306](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/5306)

## `CITATIONS.md`

Citations you added might have been removed in the template update.

#### Resolution

Reject the incoming changes to keep your citations.

## `conf/base.config`

The above mentioned removal of `check_max()` might cause conflicts in the config files

```diff title="conf/base.config"
<<<<<<< HEAD
-    cpus   = { check_max( 1    * task.attempt, 'cpus'   ) }
-    memory = { check_max( 6.GB * task.attempt, 'memory' ) }

+    memory = { 6.GB   * task.attempt }
+    time   = { 4.h    * task.attempt }
>>>>>>> TEMPLATE
```

#### Resolution

Double-check the values and accept the incoming changes if correct.

## `.nf-core.yml`

There might be conflicts due to changed order, renamed and new fields, especially in the `template` section.

#### Resolution

Double-check the changes for duplicates and accept the incoming changes.

The new file should follow this structure:

```yaml title=".nf-core.yml"
bump_version: null
lint: null
nf_core_version: 3.0.0
org_path: null
template:
    author: Author Name
    description: The description of the pipeline
    force: false
    is_nfcore: true
    name: pipelinename
    org: nf-core
    outdir: .
    skip_features: []
    version: 3.0.0
update: null
```

See the [API docs](/docs/nf-core-tools/api_reference/dev/api/utils#pydantic-modelpythonnf_coreutilsnfcoretemplateconfigpython) for a more detailed description of each field and the allowed input values.

## `nextflow.config`

Several merge conflicts due to changes described in [Important Template Updates](#important-template-updates).

#### Resolution

Double-check in the parameters section, that no pipeline-specific parameter would be removed by the incoming changes. In general, you can accept the incoming changes for this file.

## Pipeline utils subworkflow

In `subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_$PIPELINE_NAME_pipeline/main.nf` the switch to `nf-schema` might cause conflicts in the logic of reading in a samplesheet.

#### Resolution

Be careful in accepting incoming changes. The main changes you should do are:

```diff title="subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_$PIPELINE_NAME_pipeline/main.nf"
- include { fromSamplesheet } from 'plugin/nf-validation'
+ include { samplesheetToList } from 'plugin/nf-schema'
```

```diff title="subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_$PIPELINE_NAME_pipeline/main.nf"
- Channel.fromSamplesheet("input")
+ Channel.fromList(samplesheetToList(params.input, "path/to/samplesheet/schema"))
```

```diff title="subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_$PIPELINE_NAME_pipeline/main.nf"
-  UTILS_NFVALIDATION_PLUGIN (
+  UTILS_NFSCHEMA_PLUGIN (
```

See the [nf-schema migration guide](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/2.0/migration_guide/) for more details in replacing the `fromSamplesheet` function.
