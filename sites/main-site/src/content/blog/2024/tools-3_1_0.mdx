This release comes with some new features and smaller pipeline template, which shouldn't cause too much of a headache.
As always, if you have any problems or run into any bugs, reach out on the [#tools slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE5LG7WMB).

# Highlights

## Research Object (RO) Crates in nf-core pipelines

    RO Crate is an open-source standard which we use to describe our pipelines and their components in a structured way and helps with automated provenance tracking.
    In our case, it describes all files that are in the pipeline template, as well as the pipeline authors, besides some general metadata.
    More information about RO Crates can be found [here](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).
    Thanks to [Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels), [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://github.com/stain) and [Simone Leo ](https://github.com/simleo) for kicking off this effort and providing useful feedback!

    :::note
    This RO Crate describes the pipeline as a whole, not pipeline runs.
    For that kind of provenance, use the new [nf-prov plugin](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-prov), which is currently in development.
    :::

    If you want to update the RO Crate for your pipeline, run `nf-core pipelines rocrate` (automatically run with `nf-core pipelines sync`).

    For more information about the command and how it generates the RO Crate, see [the docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/pipelines/rocrate).

## ORAS container URI support in `nf-core pipelines download`

    Previously, you needed to use a `https://` prefix, but thanks to the work by [@MatthiasZepper](https://github.com/MatthiasZepper) we can now use the `oras://` prefix.
    This requires singularity to be installed on your system.

## `main` as optional default branch

    With this release we extended the template and tooling to support either `main` or `master` as the default release branch for pipelines.

If you want to use the `main` branch in your pipeline, make sure to set `defaultBranch = main` on the `manifest` section from the `nextflow.config` file. Afterwards, you can change the GitHub repository default branch to `main`.

Then, you can run `nf-core pipelines sync` again. This will automatically change all the required links from `master` to `main`.

## `nf-core subworkflows patch`

    This new commandallows you to patch subworkflows in the same way as you would patch modules.

# Miscellaneous

- When running `nf-core pipelines create` you can now toggle all pipelines features on and off with one switch.
- The template now includes an expanded contributors section in the manifest, as introduced in [Nextflow 24.10.0](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/config.html#manifest) for details.
  We added a new `TODO nf-core` comment, so please add the missing information to these fields.
  Completing these fields will allow us for example to improve the data in the RO crate, especially the ORCID.

    The newly added fields are:

    ```groovy title="nextflow.config" {2-11}
    manifest {
        contributors = [
            [
                name: '',
                affiliation: '',
                email: '',
                github: '',
                contribution: [], // List of contribution types ('author', 'maintainer' or 'contributor')
                orcid: ''
            ],
        ]
    }
    ```

- We moved `includeConfig 'conf/modules.config'` next to `includeConfig 'conf/base.config'` to not overwrite tests profiles configurations.
  Thanks to [Louis Le Nézet](https://github.com/LouisLeNezet) for adding this change.

# Possible merge conflicts and how to resolve them

## `.nf-core.yml`

We started to clean null values from the `.nf-core.yml` file, so if you get something like the following, you can accept this change.

```diff
<<<<<<< nf-core-template-merge-3.1.0
+ nf_core_version: 3.1.0
=======
- nf_core_version: 3.0.1
- org_path: null
>>>>>>> dev
```

### Resolution

You can just accept the changes that don't include null values, i.e. the ones coming from `nf-core-template-merge-3.1.0`.
