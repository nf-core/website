The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to give further insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers)
by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

In the November meeting we discussed (amongst others) the following topics:

-   [Stricter SemVer versioning](#stricter-semver-versioning)
-   [Push for BAM to CRAM?](#push-for-bam-to-cram)
-   [Removal of `workflowCitation()`](#removal-of-workflowcitation)
-   [Recent CI approach changes](#recent-ci-approach-changes)
-   [Modules piling up](#modules-piling-up)

## Stricter SemVer versioning

We immediately dove into what was expected to be a prickly topic: Jon Manning raised concerns about the 'loose' use of [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/), within nf-core pipeline release versioning.

Jon pointed out that different pipelines take different approaches, with few adhering strictly to ‘true’ SemVer rules.
The primary issue revolved around ‘major releases’.
According to SemVer, transitioning from version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 signifies a breaking change—a change that alters the software’s functionality such that existing usage patterns no longer work.

However, many nf-core pipelines have used major version bumps to indicate substantial new functionalities or extensive back-end codebase refactoring, even when these changes do not disrupt user interactions.

This sparked a discussion about the pros and cons of alternative versioning systems.

James Fellows Yates and Jose Espinosa suggested that the ‘misuse’ of SemVer within nf-core stems partly from the technical nature of the SemVer specification, which can be challenging to apply to pipelines.

This complexity often leads to misinterpretation, particularly when comparing the formal SemVer definition of ‘major’ releases to how they are currently used in pipelines.

Florian Wuennemann, showcasing his enthusiasm for AI ([Nextflow advent calendar](https://flowuenne.github.io/nextflow_advent_calender/) anyone?), proposed using a large language model (LLM) to scan the codebase on dev branches and determine the appropriate versioning automatically.
While this idea was met with skepticism from some AI critics in the group, it sparked a productive conversation about whether tooling and automation could assist developers in evaluating the appropriate version bump for a release.

The group agreed that Jon would prepare a [PR](https://github.com/nf-core/website/pull/2842) where the community could collectively define ‘rules’ for different release types, adhering to SemVer principles as much as possible.
(Note: The PR has since been merged, but it remains open for updates from the community.)

Following this, Júlia Mir Pedrol and the infrastructure team committed to exploring tooling that could suggest the most appropriate version bump during the linting process before a new release.

## Push for BAM to CRAM?

Maxime Garcia spoke on behalf of Friederike Hanssen (Rike) who raised the question of whether nf-core should initiate a widespread push to replace BAM files with CRAM files across all modules.

[CRAM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM_(file_format)>) files are a highly compressed version of SAM and BAM files, offering significant reductions in hard drive usage for reference genome-aligned DNA/RNA sequencing data.

Although CRAM files are natively supported by modern versions of the HTSlib SAMTools suite, many maintainers hesitated to enforce or advocate for their adoption despite the potential benefits.
Concerns centered around the substantial effort that such a shift would entail.
Adam Talbot and James exchanged knowing, bitter laughs over their experiences with ‘C’ programming and ancient DNA tools.

The primary challenge lies in tool compatibility.
Many bioinformatics tools used in nf-core pipelines either lack support for recent versions of HTSlib or have hardcoded BAM as the required input format.
Transitioning to CRAM would not only involve updating nf-core modules but could also necessitate patching the codebases of numerous tools—often written in diverse programming languages, and many of which are no longer actively maintained.

The group agreed to avoid a broad mandate for now.
Instead, Rike was encouraged to propose ways to raise awareness of CRAM’s benefits during the review process.
Additionally, there was consensus on emphasizing CRAM adoption in the module specifications to encourage its use where feasible.

## Removal of `workflowCitation()`

Júlia presented her [proposal](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/7094) to remove the `workflowCitation()` function from the nf-core pipeline template.

This function was originally used to display citation information at the start of a pipeline run, encouraging users to cite the pipeline’s publication, the nf-core project, and relevant dependencies.
However, it had not been actively used elsewhere in the pipeline template for some time.
Although Júlia had previously inquired about its usage on Slack, she wanted to confirm with the maintainers whether anyone was still relying on it before removing it entirely.
The response was a unanimous '[PURGE](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/7094#pullrequestreview-2470115528) IT'.

If you’ve been using this function for your own purposes, take note: it will no longer be part of the nf-core template starting with the next release of nf-core/tools!

## Recent CI approach changes

Sateesh Peri provided an overview of significant changes to the nf-core/modules CI testing approach, implemented over a few weeks in November by a small team that included himself, Edmund Miller, Matthias Hörtenhuber, and a recent addition to maintainers team, Usman Rashid among others.

### Key updates to CI testing

1. Introduction of nf-test ‘Shards’
    - The use of nf-test shards enables tests defined in the nf-test script to run in parallel instead of sequentially.
    - This significantly speeds up module development cycles by providing faster feedback, especially for failures, enabling quicker iteration and resolution.
2. `--changed-since` Feature for Smarter Testing
    - The `--changed-since` flag allows tests to focus on code changes made since a specified commit hash or branch name.
    - By default, this parameter uses HEAD, but developers can specify other targets for more targeted validation.
    - This feature improves CI efficiency by avoiding redundant tests and reduces the environmental impact of running tests.
3. Support for GPU-Dependent Module Testing
    - Modules requiring GPU-enabled tools can now be tested effectively.
    - A new gpu tag triggers these tests to run on ‘self-hosted’ runners outside GitHub Actions, utilizing nf-core credits generously donated by AWS.

> The nf-core/modules CI can be seen in the modules repo `.github` folder [here](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/.github/workflows)

### Pipeline CI workflow updates

Pipelines using GPU-dependent modules must update their CI workflows to support GPU testing.
Currently, nf-core/methylseq serves as a test case for these CI updates.

The updated CI workflow involves two main github actions:

-   nf-test-shard:
    -   Performs a dry run of nf-test with the `--changed-since` flag, filtering by tags.
    -   It outputs the test shard and total number of shards.
-   nf-test:
    -   Accepts inputs such as the profile, shard, and total shard count.
    -   It filters by tags and runs the tests accordingly.

There are now two YAML workflows in the repository:

-   `nf-test.yml`:
    -   For non-GPU pipelines, running the nf-test-shard and nf-test actions.
-   `nf-test-gpu.yml`:
    -   For GPU-dependent pipelines, combining the same shard and test actions but tailored for GPU testing.

> The nf-core/methylseq CI updates are under review and will be included in the upcoming `v2.8.0` release.
> In the meantime, the implementation PR can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nf-core/methylseq/pull/478)

### Current Challenges

While these improvements mark significant progress, they aren’t without challenges.
Some maintainers noted that the test names have become less informative, making it harder to quickly identify failing tests without navigating through several layers of the GitHub Actions interface.
However, the team is already working on further enhancements to address these usability issues.

### Work in Progress

The team emphasized that these changes are just the beginning, with additional refinements and optimizations still in the pipeline especially with more nf-test CI features like `--excludeTags` feature for easier handling of tests.

## Modules piling up

To close out the discussion, our friendly neighbourhood module maestro Simon Pearce raised a concern about the growing number of open pull requests (PRs) in the module repository.

Simon encouraged community members to spare some time to help review and merge
as many PRs as possible before the new year. Even 10 minutes of effort could make a significant difference in reducing the
backlog!

Sateesh highlighted another issue: many PRs lack proper labels—such as the `Ready for Review` label—which could help developers filter and prioritize PRs that are ready for review.
Sateesh suggested making an announcement to encourage contributors to add appropriate labels based on the status of their PRs, streamlining the review process.

## The end
