# March 2024 nf-core Hackathon

From March 18-20, 2024, we held the
[March 2024 online / distributed nf-core hackathon](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024/).
People from all over the world joined us both online and in person, at local nodes.
The response from the community was overwhelming, with a phenomenal number of people
registering to join:

The year-on-year growth of hackathon attendance is fantastic to see,
once again in 2024 we smashed previous records with attendance:

In the registration form, we asked people what country they live in.
As you can see, we had people joining us from all over the globe!

The numbers in Germany were a real outlier in 2024,
likely due to the large number of local sites organised there by community members.

## Local sites

We first tried the idea of hosting local in-person hackathon nodes
[in March 2023](/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023/).
Volunteers from the community organised venues at their local workplace and invited anyone to join.
The response was extremely positive, so in 2024 we decided to take the same approach.

In the end, we had a phenomenal 23 local sites run by community volunteers.
The size and scale varied enormously, with the [GHGA](https://www.ghga.de/) site in Heidelberg, Germany,
attracting over 50 people!

These sites were also spread all over the world.
It's great to see more sites popping up in the USA especially:

## Socials

The hackathon was a lot of fun, with pizza provided by [Seqera](https://seqera.io/),
quizzes and hidden sock hunts ðŸ§¦

Our talented nf-core musicians [@TCLamnidis](https://github.com/TCLamnidis)
and [@jfy133](https://github.com/jfy133) enjoyed the hackathon so much that
they even put a song and music video together about it!

Many thanks to everyone to joined the hackathon and especially to the many
organisers who helped make it happen.
We hope to see you all again next year!
