In these sessions, seasoned APAC community members will be available to discuss your code, running pipelines, writing configs, or anything else related to nf-core and Nextflow.
They will hang out online during designated hours every week, ready to provide guidance and insights or just chat about your favorite pipeline.

APAC office hours will follow the same informal structure as the European and American office hours.
See [Office hours blog post](https://nf-co.re/blog/2024/office_hours) for more information.

Things that might be discussed include:

- You can't figure out how to run a pipeline
- You'd like to write an institution config and like some insights
- A specific concept doesn't make sense and you'd like to talk it over
- You're working on a component or pipeline, you're stuck, and you'd like to get unstuck
- You want to hang out with other Nextflow enthusiasts and get to know the faces behind the slack handles
- You'd like to swap code reviews with someone to get your PR merged
- Recent sports results

The help desk hours take place in [Gather](https://gather.town/), an online collaborative platform, kind of like Pokemon-meets-Zoom.
Follow our [Gather Town link](https://app.gather.town/app/b2RCFGS2cIGusuNi/nf-core-office) to join. See the [Gather Town bytesize talk](/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) talk for more information about the platform.

Join the [`#weekly-helpdesk`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06KSS9L8M7) for regular reminders about help desk.

We are also pleased to launch a new [`#region-apac`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C08DF6UQZDJ) Slack channel, a regional channel for the APAC nf-core community.
Join the channel, say hi, and meet others in the region!

The first week of the APAC help desk is **Wednesday, Mar 12, 2025**.

We're looking forward to seeing you at APAC weekly help desk!
