This release brings significant improvements to the download command, a new devcontainer setup, and better ARM64 architecture handling.
As always, if you have any problems or run into any bugs, reach out on the [#tools slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE5LG7WMB).

# Highlights

- [New devcontainer setup](#new-devcontainer-setup)
- [Improvements in ARM64 architecture handling](#change-in-arm-architecture-handling)
- [CLI convenience improvements](#cli-convenience-improvements)

# Refactored download command

The `nf-core download` command has received a major overhaul (see the [blog post](/blog/2025/refurbushing-the-pipeline-download) for more details about the motivation and new approach), bringing several powerful new features and improvements:

#### Nextflow inspect for container discovery

The download command now uses `nextflow inspect` to discover containers used in pipelines, replacing the legacy regex-based approach.
This provides more accurate and reliable container detection.

:::note
This requires Nextflow version 25.04.04 or later.
:::

The old regex-based container discovery could sometimes miss containers or pick up false positives.
With `nextflow inspect`, Nextflow itself tells us exactly which containers are used, making the process more robust and future-proof.

#### Docker tar archive support

You can now download Docker images directly into tar archives, making it easier to transfer and deploy pipelines in air-gapped environments:

```bash /--compress tar/
nf-core download <pipeline> --container-system docker --compress tar
```

# New devcontainer setup

With the [sunsetting of Gitpod](https://ona.com/stories/gitpod-classic-payg-sunset) (ðŸ˜¢) we recommend using GitHub Codespaces instead.

We updated therefore the devcontainer configuration to make the experience as seamless as possible.

## Improvements in ARM64 architecture handling

The template now includes better support for ARM64 architectures:

- The generic `arm` profile has been replaced with a more specific `arm64` profile
- A new `emulate_amd64` profile has been added for running AMD64 containers on ARM64 systems using emulation, which is better suited for Apple Silicon.

This provides clearer options for pipeline users working with Apple Silicon Macs and ARM64 servers

# CLI convenience improvements

### `modules lint` and `modules bump-versions` all sub-tools

If you want to bump the version of a series of modules which are based on the same tool, e.g., samtools, you can now just specify the tool name and the same command will be run on all sub-tools:

```bash
nf-core modules lint samtools
nf-core bump-versions samtools
```

Thank you [@nh13](https://github.com/nh13) for adding this feature!

### Command short-hands

All main commands have now shorter aliases:

- `nf-core pipelines{:bash}` -> `nf-core p{:bash}`
- `nf-core modules{:bash}` -> `nf-core m{:bash}`
- `nf-core subworkflows{:bash}` -> `nf-core s{:bash}`
- `test-datasets{:bash}` -> `nf-core tds{:bash}`

Thanks to the new version of [rich-click](https://ewels.github.io/rich-click/1.9/blog/2025/09/16/version-1.9/) for adding this feature (and nicer themeing)!

# Template changes

This release includes also some changes to the pipeline template.

### CI

- We switched the `download_pipeline.yml` action to use the latest version of nf-core/tools instead of `dev`.
- We fixed the failing `aws{full}test.yml` action by switching to organization-wide variables as inputs.

### Release announcements

Mastodon announcements now include the pipeline description, providing more context when pipelines are released.

### Changelog

You can find the complete changelog and technical details [on GitHub](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/3.4.0).

# Miscellaneous

## Linting

The linter now uses the organization specified in `.nf-core.yml` when checking manifest names, homepages, and MultiQC config comments.
This makes it easier to fork and customize nf-core pipelines for your own organization while maintaining proper attribution.

Thank you [@rrahn](https://github.com/rrahn) for implementing this feature!
