Running nf-core pipelines can be computationally intensive, requiring resources not easily available to students, newcomers, or participants in hands-on training workshops. This post shows two ways you can use Google Colab to run nf-core pipelines entirely in the cloud, either in a browser-based execution or connected to VSCode via the vscode-colab package for a full development experience. While Colab has limitations, such as session timeouts and a lack of root access, it offers a free and accessible platform ideal for learning, teaching, and prototyping workflows in resource-constrained environments.
