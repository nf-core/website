## Introduction

When nf-core modules were introduced, we decided to add a `meta.yml` which contains the metadata of the module.
This file describes:

- The tool(s) used in the module
- The structure of the channels
- The authors of the module

This file has been changing recently.
We identified improvements that could be made when describing the inputs and outputs of the module.
And we updated how the channels are described.
You can see the [first blog-post](https://nf-co.re/blog/2025/modules-ontology) we wrote about this changes for more context.

The first change consisted on grouping the input and output elements by channel. Before, they were all listed at the top level.
This change makes it easier to understand the channel structure of the module.

But one last detail was still missing. We were not distinguishing between tuple channels and single element channels.
Now, tuple channels correspond to lists in the `meta.yml` file. While single element channels are not included inside a list.
You can see the changes in [our PR on the modules repository](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/8747).

This is an example of the `bwa/mem` module.
See the difference beween tuple channels and single element channels such as `val sorted_bam` in the input and `versions` in the output.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-5">
        ```groovy title="main.nf"
        process BWA_MEM {

            ...

            input:
            tuple val(meta) , path(reads)
            tuple val(meta2), path(index)
            tuple val(meta3), path(fasta)
            val   sort_bam

            output:
            tuple val(meta), path("*.bam"),  emit: bam,     optional: true
            tuple val(meta), path("*.cram"), emit: cram,    optional: true
            tuple val(meta), path("*.csi"),  emit: csi,     optional: true
            tuple val(meta), path("*.crai"), emit: crai,    optional: true
            path "versions.yml",             emit: versions

To make the switch to the new structure easier for everyone using nf-core modules, you can add `--fix` to you modules lint command.

```bash
nf-core modules lint --fix bwa/mem
```

This flag will try to fix all the possible lint failures related to the meta.yml file.

### For nf-core/tools contributors

To help users create nf-core modules, we use a [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) template.
Jinja2 is used to create templates for modules, subworkflows, and pipelines.
With all the recent changes and improvements, this template was starting to get overengineered, with lots of conditionals which make it difficult to follow the code of the file.
For this reason, we decided to simplify the template, and handle the `meta.yml` file with a YAML library.

Now, the module template `meta.yml` is the most [basic template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/dev/nf_core/module-template/meta.yml) for an nf-core module. And it doesn't contain any conditionals.
This file is read as a YAML during module creation. All the possible conditions are checked in the [`generate_meta_yml_file()`](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/dev/nf_core/components/create.py#L524) funciton. And the YAML object is updated accordingly.

This will take into account:

- If the `--empty` flag was provided or not, to add `TODO` comments.
- If the module should contain a `meta`.
- It will try to find input and output information on [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/).
- It will try to complete the input and output files with [EDAM ontology](https://edamontology.org/page) terms.
