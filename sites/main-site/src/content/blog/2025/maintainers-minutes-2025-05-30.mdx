The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to give further insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers) by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

What was initially planned as a meeting focused on test data was unfortunately delayed due to key members being absent.

Maxime performed a full takeover and redirected the meeting into a presentation of the recently introduced RFC initiative from the core team.
But before all that, Louis gave us a quick run down on the pytest to nf-test tests migration effort that he has been recently spear-heading with the help of many community members.
A tools release is on its way, coming with lots of goodness.

## Pytest to nf-test tests migration for nf-core/modules

As of the day the meeting was held, only one module and one subworkflow were left to migrate 😱.
So we are hoping to finally close this issue that was started two years ago.

A HUGE thank you :people_hugging: for everyone who contributed to this huge effort of adding nf-test to [>1500 modules](https://nf-co.re/modules/)!

## RFCs aka Request For Comments

This new initiative coming from the core team is meant to help formalize and present substantial ideas to improve the nf-core.

A discussion can be started on Slack, which can lead to an issue on nf-core/proposals, which in the end can lead into a Pull Request.
For more information, please read [the documentation](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/project_proposals).
The important part is that we maintainers will discuss these proposals and coordinate with the core team to help port all of these to fruition.

## nf-core tools

The next update is HAPPENING and we're quite happy about it, as a lot of goodness is coming with it.
Please get ready to read the blogpost about it that should be going out soon.

## Maxime takeover

That is all for this Maxime takeover, this meeting was shorter than usual, as there were less issues to discuss than usual.

## The end

As always, if you want to get involved and give your input, join the discussion on relevant PRs and Slack threads!

\- :heart: from your #maintainers team!
