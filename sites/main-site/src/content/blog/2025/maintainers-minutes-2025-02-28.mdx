The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to give further insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers)
by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

In the February meeting we discussed (amongst others) the following topics:

- [Spring cleaning](#spring-cleaning)
- [Merchandise](#merchandise)
- [Hackathon projects](#hackathon)
- [Smooth running!?](#smooth-running)

## Spring cleaning

This month we again discussed the upcoming pre-hackathon spring cleaning across all common nf-core repositories (and more!).

As announced last month this will be happening between March 10th and March 14th, where we will be deleting merged branches, archiving abandoned pipelines, and general [papercuts bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_cut_bug) to keep everything spick-and-span.

So expect lots of messages, notifications, and PRs from the maintainers team as we ðŸ§¹ through!

In our discussion we defined the tasks, and started assigning the maintainers to different teams to tackle the different areas.

## Merchandise

James called for a final vote for the design of some exclusive maintainers-only merchandise that will be made available to the maintainers team.

Envious? Want a t-shirt of your favourite pipeline? You want an nf-core/mag mug? You can buy a huge range of nf-core swag on the [nf-core shop](https://nf-co.re/shop)!

_Note that we do not make any profit from any sale - everything is at cost price_.

## Hackathon projects

We also briefly discussed more ideas for 'project ideas' for the upcoming online/hybrid [hackathon in March](https://nf-co.re/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025) (it's free! Local site registrations open until March 9th!).

Hackathon projects are ways that you can pull in to solve a particular task as a team or just sit with like-minded people working on similar things.
This can be anything from adding new features to existing pipelines, adding modules for a particular tool, updating out of date documentation, working on special interest groups - pretty much anything!
If you wish to advertise a project to pull in hackathon participants, please make a [PR on the nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025#submit-a-new-project).

## Smooth running!?

Finally, we did our general round of the maintainers team to see if they felt there were any burning issues or problems with the day-to-day activities and running of the nf-core community...

...and there were none?

So, full speed ahead nf-core!

## The end

As always, if you want to get involved and give your input, join the discussion on relevant PRs and slack threads!

\- :heart: from your #maintainers team!
