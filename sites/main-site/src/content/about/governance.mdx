# Governance

nf-core is committed to being an open, inclusive, productive, and open-source community.
Anyone interested in the project can join the community and contribute to the project.
All community members must comply with the Code of Conduct (CoC) at all times.

To help manage the project, nf-core has teams that are made up of community members that oversee core activities.

This page describes the structure of the nf-core community, including how governance teams are elected, their responsibilities, and how decisions are made.

## Steering committee

Changes impacting the community require decisions informed by extensive experience with the nf-core project and the larger ecosystem.
The steering committee is responsible for overseeing the running of the nf-core project.

The steering committee is made up of representatives from the core team and outside advisors who are familiar with the project.
The steering committee is not a fixed size with its members being elected by the current steering committee.
The steering committee will meet regularly to discuss the project, funding and personnel.

##### Responsibilities

- Guiding project initiatives
- Making decisions about the project, funds, and personnel

## Core team

The core team ensures the day-to-day running of the nf-core project and oversees the activities of governance teams.

The core team is made up of community members that have demonstrated a continued commitment to the nf-core community.
New members will be invited to join the core team based on contributions, experience, and engagement with the community.
The core team will aim to have representation from different genders, geography, and employers (e.g., academia, clinical and industry).
Significant community decisions will be made by vote with any decision without a clear majority being passed to the steering committee to resolve.
Core team members will appear as organization members on the GitHub organization and have administrator access to repositories.

##### Responsibilities

- Day-to-day community decisions and coordination
- Day-to-day tasks requiring elevated permissions
    - Adding new community members to the GitHub organisation
    - Leading pipeline proposal evaluations and tracking
    - Facilitating pipeline repository transfers into nf-core organisation
    - Pipeline GitHub repository setting configuration
    - Uploading larger test-data to AWS bucket
    - Uploading pipeline megatest data to AWS bucket
    - Adding community members to the nf-core Seqera Platform workspace
    - First pipeline release reviews
    - Activating pipeline Zenodo archiving
- Attendance at the core team annual meeting
- Regular attendance at monthly core team meetings
- Sub-roles within the nf-core governance teams
- A strong community presence
