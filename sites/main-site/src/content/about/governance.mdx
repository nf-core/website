# Governance

nf-core is committed to being an open, inclusive, productive, and open-source community.
Anyone interested in the project can join the community and contribute to the project.
All community members must comply with the Code of Conduct (CoC) at all times.

To help manage the project, nf-core has teams that are made up of community members that oversee core activities.

This page describes the structure of the nf-core community, including how governance teams are elected, their responsibilities, and how decisions are made.

## Steering committee

Changes impacting the community require decisions informed by extensive experience with the nf-core project and the larger ecosystem.
The steering committee is responsible for overseeing the running of the nf-core project.

The steering committee is made up of representatives from the core team and outside advisors who are familiar with the project.
The steering committee is not a fixed size with its members being elected by the current steering committee.
The steering committee will meet regularly to discuss the project, funding and personnel.

##### Responsibilities

-   Guiding project initiatives
-   Making decisions about the project, funds, and personnel
