This week, Felix Kummer [@Felix-Kummer](https://github.com/Felix-Kummer) is going to introduce the nf-core pipeline [nf-core/rangeland](https://nf-co.re/rangeland/1.0.0/).

nf-core/rangeland is a geographical best-practice analysis pipeline for remotely sensed imagery.
The pipeline processes satellite imagery alongside auxiliary data in multiple steps to arrive at a set of trend files related to land-cover changes.
