The developers of the [nf-core/airrflow](https://nf-co.re/airrflow) workflow for BCR and TCR data analysis are organizing a virtual workshop to introduce researchers to the workflow on December 4, 2025 from 13:30 to 15:00 ET.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to nf-core/airrfow, highlighting newly implemented features, followed by a hands-on session demonstrating how to run the workflow using example data, based on the [nf-core/airrflow single-cell tutorial](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/docs/usage/single_cell_tutorial).

This event is being organised by Huimin Lyu ([@Vivian0105](https://github.com/Vivian0105)), and Gisela Gabernet ([@ggabernet](https://github.com/ggabernet)).
