# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-boston-2025` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-boston-2025).

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.
The front-matter YAML at the top of the file should be filled in as follows:

- `title`: Short and self-descriptive name for the project
- `category`: One of `pipelines`, `components`, `tooling`
- `slack`: If your project already has an obvious Slack channel (eg. a pipeline) then right click
  it and _Copy link_ and fill in here. Otherwise, create a hackathon-specific
  channel for your project with the pattern `#hack-may-2025-<project-name>`.
- `image`: A meme, silly picture or any other image to make your project more memorable.
  Add to the [`sites/main-site/src/assets/images/events/2025/hackathon-may` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/assets/images/events/2025/hackathon-may)
  as part of your PR.
- `image_alt`: Text description of your image.
- `leaders`: One or more contact people for your project (array)
    - Each key under `leaders`: Your GitHub username
        - `name`: Your name
        - `slack`: Link to your Slack user. Find this by right clicking your name in Slack and selecting _Copy link_

The body text can provide any context and background.
Projects should have at least one goal mentioned in the body text under a `## Goal` heading that you want to
try to achieve by the end of the hackathon.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and sitting down at the table of the project you're interested in.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.
