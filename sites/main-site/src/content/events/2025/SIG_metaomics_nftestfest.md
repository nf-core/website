The nf-core metagenomics community will be coming together for for a two day hackathon to implement nf-test in [meta-omics](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/meta-omics) related pipelines!
If you're developing Nextflow pipelines related to metagenomics, metaproteomics, metabolimics, metataxonomics, or microbial ecology, this could be an event for you!

The hackathon will involve a brief overview to the way nf-test is implemented at pipeline level in the nf-core template.
Then we will spend two days working together to implement nf-test in our pipelines.

We will be:

- Mostly sitting in silence and coding (without interruptions from 'normal work' ðŸ˜‰)
- Asking each other questions
- Rubberduck debugging
- Trading reviews
- Generally helping each other out with implementation (such as with generating snapshots)

All with the support of nf-test experts from within the nf-core community, including Maxime Garcia and Sateesh Peri!

This event can be for implementing nf-test in **any pipeline**, as long as it is related to meta-omics in some way.
This means official nf-core or non-nf-core, internal or public is valid!

The event is being organised by the [meta-omics](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/meta-omics) [special interest group](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups), and supported financially by the [NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/) consortium.

If you have any further questions, please contact the James Fellows Yates or Daniel Lundin via the [meta-omics Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C070369GP7T) on the nf-core slack.

## Registration

Please register in advance using [this link](https://tally.so/r/w7eZQZ).

The workshop will be hosted online (provisionally) via [gather.town](https://gather.town), with the specific link being sent out via email on registration.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should be actively developing Nextflow pipelines, ideally that use the nf-core template, or have experience in developing Nextflow and/or nf-core pipelines.

Your pipeline **does not** have to be an official nf-core pipeline to participate in this event!
