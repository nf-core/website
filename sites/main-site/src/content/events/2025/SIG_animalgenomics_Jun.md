# Multi-OMICs integration approach to breed healthier and more sustainable animals

Sustainable livestock systems offer long-term benefits by optimizing environmental impact, economic efficiency, and animal health. Implementing better breeding strategies can help to address critical challenges in agricultural sustainability, particularly in increasing feed efficiency (FE) and reducing greenhouse gas (e.g. methane) emissions from livestock production while improving health and reproduction using new multi-OMICs integrative approach. Given the urgency of achieving Net Zero emissions in agriculture by 2050, as outlined by the United Nations, we explore how cutting-edge genetic and genomic technology research can contribute to this global goal.
