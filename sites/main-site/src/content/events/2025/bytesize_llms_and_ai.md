In this weeks bytesize, Phil [[@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)] is giving a talk originally held during a SciLifeLab seminar on [Automation of research processes with LLMs and AI](https://www.scilifelab.se/event/automation/).

Nextflow has become the leading tool for scientific workflows in bioinformatics, but writing workflows can be challenging.
This bytesize talk introduces Seqera AI, a new tool that helps generate Nextflow pipelines either from scratch, from existing scripts, or even other workflow languages.
Phil will discuss how Seqera AI is able to generate best-practice DSL2 code that follows nf-core guidelines, and how we go beyond just code generation: creating and running test suites with AI agents, streamlining development while improving code quality and validation.
