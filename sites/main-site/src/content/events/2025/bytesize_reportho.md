This week, Igor ([@itrujnara](https://github.com/itrujnara)) is updating us on the newest features in the nf-core/reportho pipeline.
[nf-core/reportho](https://nf-co.re/reportho/1.1.0/) is a bioinformatics pipeline that compares and summarizes orthology predictions for one or a set of query proteins.
