In this week's bytesize, Rob Syme ([@robsyme](https://github.com/robsyme)) introduces how the concepts that make Git so helpful might also be used to improve provenance tracking and collaboration when working with Nextflow workflows. Data and metadata are handled elegantly inside of Nextflow workflows, but sensibly handling metadata on the filesystem can be a challenge. Is there a way we can move away from using paths like `/data/do-not-delete/RELECOV/samples/SAMD00818643/NextSeq 550/202116335/paired/214115_S151_R1_001.fastq.gz.1`?
