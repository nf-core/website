# How the hackathon works

## What to expect

The nf-core hackathons are collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects.

Everyone is welcome, no prior experience or nf-core contributions is needed. However, we do expect that you have some experience with writing Nextflow code.
Note that there is a separate [training event](https://summit.nextflow.io/2025/barcelona/training/) for learning Nextflow and nf-core from scratch, running in parallel to the hackathon.

nf-core hackathons are not just about coding! We also have a lot of fun. We typically run things like a quiz, a scavanger hunt and sock search.

## Prerequisites

Before you arrive at the hackathon, please make sure that you have:

- [Registered](https://summit.nextflow.io/2025/barcelona/register/) to come!
- [Joined the nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack)
- [Joined the nf-core GitHub organisation](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
- joined or been added to [`#hackathon-oct-2025` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C09ADKQ2CHZ).

## Where to find tasks

We collect all tasks in the ["Hackathon Barcelona October 2025" GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/136).

If you are not too familiar yet with the code base, a great starting point is to filter for issues labelled as `good first issue`.

Once you found something, get in touch with the project group (i.e. ping them on slack, find them in the room), assign yourself to the issue, and get started.

## How to contribute code

We use GitHub to collaborate on code:

1. Find a hackathon project
2. Discuss with the group and assign yourself to an issue. (Create one if it is not there)
3. Fork the repository
4. Work on a branch in your Fork
5. Once ready, open a PR to the parent repository

:::note
Only assign yourself to an issue if you are ready to work on it, typically one issue at a time.

See [Helpful resources](#helpful-resources) below for more information.

# Schedule

The hackathon will run from **Tuesday 28th October** 9AM to **Wednesday 29th October** 5PM.
The Hackathon social event will take place on Tuesday at the rooftop of the hackathon venue from 5:30PM to 8PM. At 10AM on Wednesday there will be the nf-core Quiz.
More information, like a more detailed schedule can be viewed [here](https://summit.nextflow.io/2025/barcelona/agenda/).

# Projects

This hackathon we will use projects, as opposed to the broader groups of previous events.
At the end of each day, we will group the projects into categories and sum up their progress.
Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

New projects can be proposed in the [`#hackathon-oct-2025` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C09ADKQ2CHZ).
Use the [project proposal form](https://slack.com/shortcuts/Ft07HAJVNF8A/295721bac20c398d998d0fed127fe3b5) to submit an idea.
After some community discussion, you can add your project to the list below and others can find it.

:::tip
If you are planning to start a new pipeline, please propose it by submitting an issue in the [nf-core/proposals repo](https://github.com/nf-core/proposals) **ahead** of the hackathon start to avoid delays during the event.
:::

Once a project is approved, the project leaders should add it to this webpage and
add issues to the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/136) ahead of the hackathon.
If appropriate, label them as `good first issue`.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them in the room, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.
