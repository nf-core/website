The developers of the [nf-core/airrflow](https://nf-co.re/airrflow) workflow for BCR and TCR data analysis are organizing a virtual workshop to introduce researchers to the workflow.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to nf-core/airrfow, highlighting newly implemented features, followed by a hands-on session demonstrating how to run the workflow using example data, based on the [nf-core/airrflow single-cell tutorial](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/docs/usage/single_cell_tutorial).

This event is being organised by Gisela Gabernet ([@ggabernet](https://github.com/ggabernet)), and Huimin Lyu ([@Vivian0105](https://github.com/Vivian0105)).

## Registration

The registration is now closed as we've reached the maximum number of participants. The tutorial video will be available on the Immcantation and nf-core YouTube channels after the event. Stay tuned for future training opportunities as well!

There are a maximum of 20 slots for the training, so please only register if you plan to attend.

The workshop will be hosted online via [zoom.com](https://zoom.com), with the specific link being sent out via email on registration.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have a basic knowledge of command line usage in a unix system (linux / MacOS), basic concepts of sequencing data analysis and a general idea of what adaptive immune repertoires are.

## Preparation

To prepare for the training, please follow the [Pre-requisites section](https://nf-co.re/airrflow/docs/usage/single_cell_tutorial#pre-requisites) of the nf-core/airrflow single-cell tutorial. We recommend using GitPod to follow the training to ensure that all the required tools are installed.
