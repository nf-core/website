## Joining remotely

The nf-core hackathon will take place both in-person and online.
If you don't have a local site near you or can't join in person, you can attend online!

The hackathon will use Slack extensively, with a main event channel as well as project-specific channels.
Attendees will be encouraged to use Slack huddle video calls, as well as asynchronous messaging over Slack.

## In person: Local sites

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

<EventLocationsTable eventPath="2025/hackathon-march-2025" showCount={true} />

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

-   Adding new features to existing pipelines
-   Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
-   Improving the website and nf-core tooling
-   Creating entirely new pipelines
-   Discussion and planning community initiatives
-   Working on special interest group topics
-   _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

Please check back soon for instructions!

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them in the room, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.

# Hosting a local site

We are now accepting registrations from organizers interested in hosting local hackathon sites :tada:

Anyone is welcome to host a site: you don't need to be an expert or have prior experience with hackathons.

What you'll need:

-   Access to a dedicated space for the duration of the event
-   Decent wifi and a bunch of extension cables
-   Enthusiasm!

Any space will do: be it a meeting room for 5-10 people through to larger spaces to accommodate more.

The steps to host a site are:

1. 👩🏻‍💻 Open a pull-request to add your site-specific page to this website
    - Create a [new site-specific `.mdx` file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025)
      and add it to the [main event page's table](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/99a45bbabbc407d60d41acbcd2c93bba69d72341/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025/index.mdx?plain=1#L105-L128).
2. 📢 Advertise - both locally and online
3. ☎️ During the event: act as a contact point with the hackathon organisers

:pizza: In previous years, Seqera has sponsored pizza.
We're not yet sure how much funding will be available in 2025 or what shape it will take,
so please don't plan around this.

:calendar: There is no closing date for local site registration, however the sooner you register your interest the better.
We use the site names in the main registration form and it really helps with planning.
Also if we know about your site we'll have more time to help advertise and get folks to join!

If you have any questions, jump into the [`#hackathon-mar-2025` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C081XQ6T3M4)
on the [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack) and we'll be happy to help.
