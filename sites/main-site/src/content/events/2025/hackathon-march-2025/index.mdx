# Welcome

Join us online and in person **March 24-26, 2025**, for the nf-core hackathon! 🗓️

The plan is to do an online + distributed hackathon, as held in [2023](/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023) and [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024).

# Registration

TBA

## Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather.
If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

Check back soon for more details!

## In person: Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2025 we hope to replicate and build on that success! 🚀

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.
