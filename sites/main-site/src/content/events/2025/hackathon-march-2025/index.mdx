## Joining remotely

The nf-core hackathon will take place both in-person and online.
If you don't have a local site near you or can't join in person, you can attend online!

The hackathon will use Slack extensively, with a main event channel as well as project-specific channels.
Attendees will be encouraged to use Slack huddle video calls, as well as asynchronous messaging over Slack.

## In person: Local sites

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

## Host a local site

We are now accepting registrations from organizers interested in hosting local hackathon sites :tada:

Anyone is welcome to host a site: you don't need to be an expert or have prior experience with hackathons.

What you'll need:

-   Access to a dedicated space for the duration of the event
-   Decent wifi and a bunch of extension cables
-   Enthusiasm!

Any space will do: be it a meeting room for 5-10 people through to larger spaces to accommodate more.

The steps to host a site are:

1. 👩🏻‍💻 Open a pull-request to add your site-specific page to this website
    - Create a [new site-specific `.mdx` file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025)
      and add it to the [main event page's table](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/99a45bbabbc407d60d41acbcd2c93bba69d72341/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025/index.mdx?plain=1#L105-L128).
2. 📢 Advertise - both locally and online
3. ☎️ During the event: act as a contact point with the hackathon organisers

For more details, see the [About nf-core hackathons](https://youtu.be/nmp0pXL7GqQ?si=QShy0tqljhgap3lV&t=220)

:pizza: In previous years, Seqera has sponsored pizza.
We're not yet sure how much funding will be available in 2025 or what shape it will take,
so please don't plan around this.

:calendar: There is no closing date for local site registration, however the sooner you register your interest the better.
We use the site names in the main registration form and it really helps with planning.
Also if we know about your site we'll have more time to help advertise and get folks to join!

If you have any questions, jump into the [`#hackathon-mar-2025` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C081XQ6T3M4)
on the [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack) and we'll be happy to help.
