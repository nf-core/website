## Joining remotely

The nf-core hackathon will take place both in-person and online.
If you don't have a local site near you or can't join in person, you can attend online!

The hackathon will use Slack extensively, with a main event channel as well as project-specific channels.
Attendees will be encouraged to use Slack huddle video calls, as well as asynchronous messaging over Slack.

## In person: Local sites

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

# Schedule

We’ve kept the main schedule intentionally light to accommodate different time zones and allow for flexibility. While we have a few key syncs and social events planned, individual sites may be following their own schedules as well. We’d love to see as many of you as possible at the daily wrap-ups and quiz—they’re a great chance to connect with the community, share progress, and have some fun. Happy hacking!

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2025` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2025).

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.
The front-matter YAML at the top of the file should be filled in as follows:

- `title`: Short and self-descriptive name for the project
- `category`: One of `pipelines`, `components`, `tooling`
- `slack`: If your project already has an obvious Slack channel (eg. a pipeline) then right click
  it and _Copy link_ and fill in here. Otherwise, leave blank as we will create a hackathon-specific
  channel for your project.
- `intro_video`: This field is not required, however it's recommended to record a short video prior to the event
  to help folks joining in other time zones to get started.
  You can also do this by recording the kick-off meeting at the start of the hackathon and adding that.
  We can help with uploading videos to the nf-core YouTube channel, just ask in Slack.
- `image`: A meme, silly picture or any other image to make your project more memorable.
  Add to the [`sites/main-site/src/assets/images/events/2025/hackathon-march` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/assets/images/events/2025/hackathon-march)
  as part of your PR.
- `image_alt`: Text description of your image.
- `leaders`: One or more contact people for your project (array)
    - Each key under `leaders`: Your GitHub username
        - `name`: Your name
        - `slack`: Link to your Slack user. Find this by right clicking your name in Slack and selecting _Copy link_

The body text can provide any context and background.
Projects should have at least one goal mentioned in the body text under a `## Goal` heading that you want to
try to achieve by the end of the hackathon.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them in the room, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.

# Hosting a local site

We are now accepting registrations from organizers interested in hosting local hackathon sites :tada:

Anyone is welcome to host a site: you don't need to be an expert or have prior experience with hackathons.

What you'll need:

- Access to a dedicated space for the duration of the event
- Decent wifi and a bunch of extension cables
- Enthusiasm!

Any space will do: be it a meeting room for 5-10 people through to larger spaces to accommodate more.

The steps to host a site are:

1. 👩🏻‍💻 Open a pull-request to add your site-specific page to this website
    - Create a [new site-specific `.mdx` file](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025)
      and add it to the [main event page's table](https://github.com/nf-core/website/blob/99a45bbabbc407d60d41acbcd2c93bba69d72341/sites/main-site/src/content/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025/index.mdx?plain=1#L105-L128).
2. 📢 Advertise - both locally and online
3. ☎️ During the event: act as a contact point with the hackathon organisers

:pizza: In previous years, Seqera has sponsored pizza.
We're not yet sure how much funding will be available in 2025 or what shape it will take,
so please don't plan around this.

:calendar: There is no closing date for local site registration, however the sooner you register your interest the better.
We use the site names in the main registration form and it really helps with planning.
Also if we know about your site we'll have more time to help advertise and get folks to join!

If you have any questions, jump into the [`#hackathon-mar-2025` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C081XQ6T3M4)
on the [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack) and we'll be happy to help.

# Social activities

During the hackathon, we will have a bit of light-hearted fun and games for you to play!
Special prizes are up for grabs for the winners!

- Online quiz
- Hackathon bingo
