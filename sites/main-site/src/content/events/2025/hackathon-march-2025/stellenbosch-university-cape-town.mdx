    - Introduce participants to intermediate topics in Nextflow, nf-core, and bioinformatics, with an emphasis on open and reproducible research.

2. Focus Areas
    - Setting up and running pipelines
    - Reproducibility: version control, containerization, interoperability
    - Pipeline optimization and debugging
    - AI and collaboration in open science
    - Infrastructure and cloud computing

3. Expected Outcomes
    - Gain skills in running and optimizing nf-core pipelines for their research needs
    - Receive an introduction to Seqera AI, Seqera Cloud, Seqera Data Studios, and Seqera Containers

### Preparation (optional but recommended)

- Nextflow Training: https://training.nextflow.io
- nf-core Tutorial: https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/
- Intro to Nextflow & nf-core: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/workflows-nextflow/
- Reproducibility & Version Control: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fairbio-practice/
- Git & GitHub Guide: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668

### Interest Groups

💡 Why are the generic pipelines recommended for all participants?
The generic pipelines provide foundational knowledge of nf-core infrastructure and are especially useful for participants who do not yet have access to their own data.

All participants will first run three generic nf-core pipelines (on Day 1) before choosing an interest group:

0. Generic pipelines
1. Transcriptomics pipelines
2. Metagenomics pipelines
3. Human Genomics pipelines

| Interest Group  |       Pipeline        |                                            Usage                                             |                                                   Input                                                    |                                                  Function                                                   |
