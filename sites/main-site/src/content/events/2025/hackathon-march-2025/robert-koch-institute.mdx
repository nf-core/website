### Optional nf-core training: A practical introduction to nf-core components for Nextflow developers

On the first day of the Hackathon, nf-core core-team member James A. Fellows Yates ([@jfy133](https://nfcore.slack.com/team/UEM37TBAR)) will give an (optional) on-site half- to one-day training on how to use nf-core components in your own Nextflow code.

The scope is:

-   What is nf-core
-   Introduction to the nf-core community and tooling
-   How to create a nf-core module
-   How to use/install modules in your own Nextflow (both nf-core and non-nf-core) pipelines

This is _not_ a Nextflow training. Participants are expected to have some Nextflow experience in writing small Nextflow pipelines and should be familiar with the content of the [Hello Nextflow training](https://training.nextflow.io/hello_nextflow/).

Please note that registration at the local site via the [Hackathon registration](https://seqera.typeform.com/nfcoremarch2025) is still necessary to join us on-site!

Please register [here](https://terminplaner6.dfn.de/de/p/2c30b03745d9f646c2efbd31b02732e3-1078800) for the one-day nf-core training.

### Food

We have an in-house cafeteria for lunch that accepts cards and cash.

### Social

We will also arrange a social dinner in one of the evenings if there is interest among the attendees.
