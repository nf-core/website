:::

The training is entirely virtual and free.
The main material is the "Hello Nextflow" training course.
This has been rewritten from the ground up to teach you everything you need
(and nothing you don't) for your first steps with writing and running Nextflow pipelines.

If you're ready for something more, we have more on offer - there are also new courses
for Genomics, RNAseq, as well as "side-quests" for things like nf-test.

# Support during training week.

Seqera staff, Nextflow Ambassadors and other community members will be watching the
"Training" category in the Nextflow community forum: <https://community.seqera.io/c/training/39>
As you follow the training, drop any problems or questions there and they will be on hand
for super fast help üöÄ

The YouTube videos will remain online after the training week, so don't worry if you
can't make the dates (and our community is super helpful all year around üòç).

If you're intending to join, please sign up by clicking [here](https://seqera.typeform.com/to/uB53tu6g).
This helps us to understand how many people will be attending and will help us to plan for future events.

You can find instructions and FAQ about how thw training will run
in the [Nextflow Training Week Instructions ](https://community.seqera.io/t/nextflow-training-week-instructions/1774).
