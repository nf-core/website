:::info{title="Key dates"}

:::

To get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons
that we held in [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) and [2025](/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025).

## Hybrid format: In-person hubs and online

This hackathon follows a **hybrid format** with in-person local hubs and online participation.

:::warning{title="Important: Choosing your project"}

Each project will be designated for a specific location: either a particular in-person hub or online.

**Project participation:**

- Projects at in-person hubs are primarily intended for attendees at that specific hub
- Online projects are designed for remote participants
- Project leaders will be present at their designated location and may not be available across sites

**When choosing a project:**

- If attending an in-person hub, choose a project designated for your hub
- If participating online, choose from projects marked as "online"
- Cross-site projects may be coordinated by project and site leads, but require additional planning due to time zones and logistics

:::

### Online

Online participation allows you to join from anywhere:

- Core team members, maintainers, and other community leaders will be present throughout the event
- Dedicated online platform and communication tools for collaboration (more details coming soon)
- Project leaders designated as "online" will be available to work with remote participants

### In-person local hubs

In-person local hubs allow you to join in person:

- Hosted at various locations around the world
- Sponsored by Seqera (as in previous years)
- Projects at each hub will have designated leaders present on-site
- Provide space for face-to-face collaboration and networking

:::tip{title="Tips for cross-site collaboration"}

If project and site leads agree to coordinate a cross-site project, here are some recommendations:

- Spanning time zones can help teams work like a relay, with brief morning/evening overlaps for handoffs rather than working simultaneously
- Booking a dedicated room at your local site might be needed for video calls
- Having more than one person doing the same project at your site is highly recommended
- Large projects can be divided into focused sub-projects, with each site owning and leading a specific component

:::

## Registration

Registration details coming soon!

# Schedule

We'll keep the main schedule intentionally light to accommodate different time zones and allow for flexibility.
We'll have daily wrap-ups and social events planned.

- Daily wrap-up sessions (times TBD)
- Quiz social events
- _more details coming soon.._

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

If you are joining online, reach out to the online project leaders.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026).

**Important**: When submitting your project, specify its primary location (a specific in-person hub or "online"). This helps participants choose projects that match where they'll be attending.

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.
