:::info{title="Key dates"}

:::

To get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons
that we held in [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) and [2025](/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025).

## Hybrid format: In-person hubs and online participation

This hackathon will follow a **hybrid format** with in-person local hubs and online participation.
Based on feedback from previous events, we're making some changes to improve the experience for everyone:

:::warning{title="Important: Choosing your project"}

Collaboration across different sites and time zones can be challenging, and we want to make sure everyone has a great experience.
To ensure the best experience, we're making recommendations to **limit split projects** across multiple locations.

**When choosing a project:**

- Each project will have a primary location (a specific hub or "online")
- Project leaders will be present and attentive at their specified location throughout the hackathon, in person or online
- If you attend a specific hub, we strongly recommend choosing a project based at the site you'll be attending

If you're attending online, we suggest you join projects marked as "online" or consider projects at hubs in your time zone.

:::

### Strengthening online presence

We're aiming to improve the online experience:

- More core team members, maintainers, and other community leaders will provide online coverage throughout the event
- Continued attention and presence to ensure it doesn't feel empty when people join
- Improved online platform and communication tools (more details coming soon)

### In-person local hubs

We encourage ambassadors and community members to organize in-person local hubs.
Seqera will support local hubs with sponsorship as in previous years.
These hubs are invaluable for community building and collaborative work.

:::tip{title="Tips for cross-site collaboration"}

If you still want to collaborate across sites, here are some recommendations:

- Spanning time zones makes it easier (e.g., projects with morning/evening overlap)
- Booking a dedicated room at your local site might be needed for video calls
- Having more than one person doing the same project at your site is highly recommended

:::

:::tip{.fa-globe title="Time zones"}

The hackathon runs from March 11-13, wherever you are.
Event attendees will span the globe, so there should be some people online.
Most people will work 9am - 5pm each day.

## Registration

Registration details coming soon!

# Schedule

We'll keep the main schedule intentionally light to accommodate different time zones and allow for flexibility.
We'll have daily wrap-ups and social events planned.
Happy hacking!

- Daily wrap-up sessions (times TBD)
- Quiz social events
- _more details coming soon.._

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026).

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.
