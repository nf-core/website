# Welcome

Join us online **March 11-13, 2026**, for the nf-core hackathon! 🗓️

This is a fully online event where you can join for free from wherever you are
to hack with other Nextflow / nf-core enthusiasts!

:::info{title="Key dates"}

To get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons
that we held in [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) and [2025](/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025).

The Spring 2026 nf-core hackathon will take place entirely online.
The hackathon will use Slack extensively, with a main event channel as well as project-specific channels.
Attendees will be encouraged to use Slack huddle video calls, as well as asynchronous messaging over Slack.

:::tip{.fa-globe title="Time zones"}

The hackathon runs from March 11-13, wherever you are.
Event attendees will span the globe, so there should be some people online, wherever you are.
Most people will work 9am - 5pm each day.

## Registration

Registration details coming soon!

# Schedule

We've kept the main schedule intentionally light to accommodate different time zones and allow for flexibility.
We'll have daily wrap-ups and social events planned.
Happy hacking!

- Daily wrap-up sessions (times TBD)
- Quiz social events
- _more details coming soon.._

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026).

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.
