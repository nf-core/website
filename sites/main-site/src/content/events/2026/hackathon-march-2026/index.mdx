Event attendees will span the globe, so there should be some people online.
Most people will work 9am - 5pm each day.

## Registration

Registration details coming soon!

# Schedule

We'll keep the main schedule intentionally light to accommodate different time zones and allow for flexibility.
We'll have daily wrap-ups and social events planned.
Happy hacking!

- Daily wrap-up sessions (times TBD)
- Quiz social events
- _more details coming soon.._

# Projects

We'll work in projects during the hackathon. Projects can be anything from:

- Adding new features to existing pipelines
- Adding and improving components (modules / subworkflows)
- Improving the website and nf-core tooling
- Creating entirely new pipelines
- Discussion and planning community initiatives
- Working on special interest group topics
- _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead person who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

If you have an idea for a project that you think would be fun to do during the hackathon,
please add it to the website by submitting a pull-request to the `nf-core/website` repository.

You need to add a new markdown file to the
[`sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026` directory](https://github.com/nf-core/website/tree/main/sites/main-site/src/content/hackathon-projects/hackathon-march-2026).

See existing files for examples, if you're unsure about anything please ask in Slack or in the pull-request.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.
