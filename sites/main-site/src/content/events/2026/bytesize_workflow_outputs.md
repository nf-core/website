This is a recorded bytesize talk by Chris Hakkaart ([@christopher-hakkaart](https://github.com/christopher-hakkaart)) about a new feature that is introduced to Nextflow and nf-core pipelines: workflow outputs.
The workflow output definition is a new way to define the top-level outputs of a workflow. It is a replacement for the publishDir directive.

DISCLAIMER: there is still some ongoing work on the implementation, so the current use might differ slightly from what is shown in this bytesize.

You can find more information on the [Nextflow documentations page](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/tutorials/workflow-outputs.html).
