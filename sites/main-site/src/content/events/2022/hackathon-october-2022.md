# Welcome

Please join us for the October 2022 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2022**_ in Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸. You can find out more information about the summit at <https://summit.nextflow.io>.

In addition to the in-person event, we will endeavour to run a hybrid option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of nextflow and/or nf-core. If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there will be free online workshops spanning all global timezones in the week before the hackathon. For more information and the training registration link, see the [Nextflow and nf-core training event page](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/training-october-2022).

# Registration

Registration for the in-person hackathon event is now closed. You can still register for the on-line event and the Nextflow Summit: <https://summit.nextflow.io/register>

# Groups

To keep work and discussion during the hackathon manageable, we will organise everyone into groups.
You are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.

Since the Nextflow Summit is going to be held just after the hackathon, we decided to keep presentations to a minimum. There will however be some workshops. More details about those will be given closer to the event.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub _project board_ (we'll post a link to here closer to the time). There will be a separate tab for each group where will have collated a list of relevant issues.

## Group 1 - Documentation

This group will focus on all kind of documentation, from pipelines themselves to modules and general documentation to aid in getting started with nf-core and Nextflow. We are also planning on making introduction videos for each pipeline.

[<i class="fab fa-slack"></i> `#hackathon-oct-2022-documentation`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C041QU9SX09)

### Group leaders

- Abhinav Sharma (in person),
- Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas (in person),
- Franziska Bonath (online)

## Group 2 - Subworkflows

Why stop at sharing modules, we want to share subworkflows between pipelines too! Join this group to work on the cutting edge of nf-core development, fleshing out details about how this functionality will work and building proof of concept code to use as a model for the rest of nf-core. Recommended for relatively experienced Nextflow / nf-core contributors only.

[<i class="fab fa-slack"></i> `#hackathon-oct-2022-subworkflows`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C0419AX2RD3)

### Group leaders

- Edmund Miller (in person),
- Harshil Patel (in person),
- Maxime Garcia (in person),
- Yuk Kei Wan (online)

## Group 3 - Pipelines

This group will focus on any pipeline related work, this could be:

- DSL2 conversion of a pipeline
- New / improved features for a pipeline
- Entirely new pipelines

[<i class="fab fa-slack"></i> `#hackathon-oct-2022-pipelines`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C0415MM9FHC)

### Group leaders

- Maxime Garcia (in person),
- James Fellows Yates (in person),
- Friederike Hanssen (in person),
- Luis Kuhn (online)

## Group 4 - Modules

This group will welcome anyone who wants to work on new modules or improve existing ones.

[<i class="fab fa-slack"></i> `#hackathon-oct-2022-modules`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C0415MQNW14)

### Group leaders

- Jose Espinosa-Carrasco (in person),
- Gisela Gabernet (in person),
- Louisa Perelo (online)

## Group 5 - Infrastructure

The nf-core website is in desperate need of work, and central tooling always needs to be improved and maintained. If this sounds like a fun task, join group 5!

[<i class="fab fa-slack"></i> `#hackathon-oct-2022-infrastructure`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C040XNUL7DM)

### Group leaders

- Matthias Hörtenhuber (in person),
- Júlia Mir Pedrol (in person)

## How we will work

We will be a lot of people working in parallel during this hackathon, so to stay organised we have a recommended workflow:

1. :speech_balloon: Chat with your group to get an overview of what is going on
2. <i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Join the relevant Slack channel to stay up to date and discuss with your project members
3. <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Find a task to work on using the GitHub Project Board
   - If you have something you want to do that's not there, please make an issue and add it to the board
4. :raising_hand: Assign yourself to the issue that you're currently working on (preferably one issue at a time)
   - This is so that multiple people don't accidentally work on the same task
5. :fast_forward: When you're done, make a pull-request with your changes. Link it to the issue so that the issue closes when merged.
6. :page_facing_up: Describe your work on the HackMD document for the project and tell the group! :tada:
7. :recycle: Repeat!

> The HackMD document is the easiest to forget, but please add something even if you think what you did was small -
> we will use it in the group check-outs for each day and also in the reporting after the event so it's important for us :bow:

# Community Streaming Events

Community streaming events are a great way to engage with your local communities while participating in events remotely. By simply booking a room and gathering your colleagues you can create discussion and build your community while enjoying the training, nf-core Hackathon, and/or Nextflow Summit together.

If this is something you are interested in you can tell us about your plans using the link below. We will send you extra material to help you prepare and promote your local event. To get started we have a [poster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQDtrVUv1Lro5lZFmeyfaPgJUI2pmGojtL9tWlQiVyQ/edit) that you can download, edit, and share.

Keep an eye out for others hosting community events in your area. We will be sharing information about community events and how to get in contact with hosts on our website.

You can add your community event using [this link](https://seqera.typeform.com/streaming-event).

## Social Activities

During the hackathon, we will have a few light-hearted fun and games!
