## Best practice for preparing pipelines in nf-core and recording pipeline usage in FAANG submission

The [EuroFAANG](https://eurofaang.eu/) virtual
training course on best practice for submitting experiment and analysis data to FAANG, includes a seminar and demonstration from the [BovReg]
(https://www.bovreg.eu/) project members from the Centre for Genomic
Regulation on the key role that [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) plays in
standardising FAANG data analysis and promoting reproducibility.

Presenters:

Jose Espinosa-Carrasco will be presenting and running a demo to showcase the best practice for recording nf-core pipeline usage, parameters and outputs to then submit to FAANG for fully reproducible analyses.
