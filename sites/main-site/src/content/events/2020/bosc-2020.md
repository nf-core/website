## About the conference

[BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/), the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference,
is an annual meeting for those interested in the open-source:
[https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/)

> _"The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference promotes and facilitates the open source
> development of bioinformatics tools and open science."_

In 2020, it is being held together with the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC) in a joint online meeting:
[https://bcc2020.github.io/](https://bcc2020.github.io/)

## What’s new with nf-core: community-built bioinformatics pipelines

Phil Ewels will be giving a 5-minute lightning talk about updates to nf-core since it was last presented at BOSC 2019.

**Please note that the talk will be shown _twice_**, in both hemispheres.
In the European `CET` time zone:

- [July 21: 16:15 - 16:20](https://bcc2020.sched.com/event/coM8/whats-new-with-nf-core-community-built-bioinformatics-pipelines)
- [July 22: 04:15 - 04:20](https://bcc2020.sched.com/event/cssq/whats-new-with-nf-core-community-built-bioinformatics-pipelines)

See the schedule at the above links to customise for your time zone.

The talk will be available on YouTube for anyone to watch after the conference. It will be posted on this page when ready.

### Abstract

Analysis pipelines and computational workflows are increasingly becoming a core component in life-science research. Standardisation of software packaging (bioconda, docker, singularity) can now come together with workflow managers and languages (Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL, WDL) to facilitate analysis workflows that can be truly portable across virtually any computational infrastructure (server, HPC, cloud).

Over the past two years _nf-core_ has grown to be a truly global collaborative effort to collect gold-standard workflows built using Nextflow. All pipelines adhere to strict guidelines and are built using a common template, with consistent usage patterns and best-in-class testing and support.

The year since Alex Peltzer’s presentation at BOSC 2019 has been one of rapid growth and development. In this talk I will describe some of the major developments, including:

- Nearly double the community size, with over 1000 twitter followers and 500 GitHub contributors at time of writing (see [https://nf-co.re/stats](https://nf-co.re/stats) for details)
- Growth to [43 pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) (11 new since BOSC 2019, with 8 newly stable)
- Publication of a [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x) in _Nature Biotechnology_ describing the community
- New user-friendly tools to launch pipelines, using JSON schema describing parameters

I’ll also point to future developments coming soon, such as migration to Nextflow DSL2 with modular code and improved code testing: both unit testing and full-scale data tests.
