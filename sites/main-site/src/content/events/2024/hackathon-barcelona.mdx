# How the hackathon works

## What to expect

The nf-core hackathons are collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects.

Everyone is welcome, no prior experience of nf-core contributions is needed. However, we do expect that you have some experience with writing Nextflow code.
Note that there is a separate [training event](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/training/) for learning Nextflow and nf-core from scratch, running in parallel to the hackathon.

nf-core hackathons are not just about coding! We also have a lot of fun. We typically run things like a quiz, a bingo and have several small prizes for the winners.
In addition to small social games and contests during the event, we also have a social evening.

## Prerequisites

Before you arrive at the hackathon, please make sure that you have:

-   [Registered](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/register/) to come!
-   [Joined the nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack)
-   [Joined the nf-core GitHub organisation](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
-   Added yourself to the [`#hackathon-oct-2024` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07HZCK6YE4)

## Where to find tasks

We collect all tasks in the ["Hackathon October 2024" GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/76).

If you are not too familiar yet with the code base, a great starting point is to filter for issues labelled as `good first issue`.

Once you found something, get in touch with the project group (i.e. ping them on slack, find them in the room), assign yourself, and get started.

## How to contribute code

We use GitHub to collaborate on code:

{/* TODO link to external docs on this? */}

1. Find a hackathon project
2. Discuss with the group and assign yourself to an issue. (Create one if it is not there)
3. Fork the repository
4. Work on a branch in your Fork
5. Once ready, open a PR to the parent repository

:::note
Only assign yourself to an issue if you are ready to work on it, typically one issue at a time.
:::

See [Helpful resources](#helpful-resources) below for more information.

# Schedule

The hackathon will run from **Monday 28th October** to **Wednesday 30th October**.
The registration opens on Monday at **9am**. We will start at **10am** everyday and close at **5pm** on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday we will wrap up at **1pm**.
For a complete schedule visit the [summit agenda page](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/agenda/)

# Projects

This hackathon we will use projects, as opposed to the broader groups of previous events.
At the end of each day, we will group the projects into categories and sum up their progress.
Projects can be anything from:

-   Adding new features to existing pipelines
-   Adding and improving nf-core/modules
-   Improving the website and nf-core tooling
-   Creating entirely new pipelines
-   Discussion and planning community initiatives
-   Working on special interest group topics
-   _...anything else_

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

New projects can be proposed in the [`#hackathon-oct-2024` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07HZCK6YE4).
Use the [project proposal form](https://slack.com/shortcuts/Ft07HAJVNF8A/295721bac20c398d998d0fed127fe3b5) to submit an idea.
After a some community discussion, you can add your project to the list below and others can find it.

:::tip
If you are planning to start a new pipeline, please propose it on the [`#new-pipelines` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDEDAA)
**ahead** of the hackathon start to avoid delays during the event.
:::

Once a project is approved, the project leaders should add it to this webpage and
add issues issues to the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/76) ahead of the hackathon.
If appropriate, label them as `good first issue`.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them in the room, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.

# List of projects

## Pipelines

<HackathonGroup
    title="nf-core/seqinspector"
    category="pipelines"
    leaders={{'FranBonath': 'Franziska Bonath'}}
    goal="Work towards a first release"
    slack="seqinspector"
>
    nf-core/seqinspector aims to be a pipeline for initial quality control of sequencing data. Input is either FASTQ files or a run folder, and output is planned to be a global MultiQC report and, if wished, MultiQC files of groups that are defined in the sample sheet.
    By joining this group you can
        1) add existing modules to a pipeline (beginner friendly)
        2) write a new module of your preferred QC tool if it doesn’t exist yet (intermediate level).
        3) start with implementation of long read methods (advanced level, we have only limited experience in the group, so help would be more than appreciated!).
        4) work on display of the data in the MultiQC reports (beginner - intermediate level)
        5) write documentation

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Single cell analysis: nf-core/scrnaseq and nf-core/scdownstream"
    category="pipelines"
    leaders={{'nictru': 'Nico Trummer'}}
    goal="Move shared functionality to nf-core/modules and make #scdownstream ready for 1.0 release"
>
    [nf-core/scrnaseq](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq) transforms FASTQ files into expression matrices, while [nf-core/scdownstream](https://nf-co.re/scdownstream) receives expression matrices as input and performs quality control, integration, clustering and more.
    This project has two main parts:
        1) Move some local modules from scdownstream to nf-core/modules so that they can be re-used in scrnaseq.
        2) Add new features to scdownstream. See the open [enhancement issues](https://github.com/nf-core/scdownstream/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) for details.

    By joining this group you can:
        1) Create new modules and move existing local modules to nf-core/modules (beginner friendly)
        2) Integrate the newly added modules into the pipelines (beginner - intermediate level)
        3) Improve the scdownstream MultiQC report and documentation (beginner - intermediate level)
        4) Look into a potential extension of scdownstream to multi-omics analyses (advanced level, has not yet been tackled but help would be great!)

    Prior experience with single cell analysis is not required, but helpful.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="nf-core/deepmodeloptim"
    category="pipelines"
    leaders={{'mathysgrapotte': 'Mathys Grapotte'}}
    goal="Reach nf-core/deepmodeloptim v1.0.0 release!"
    slack="deepmodeloptim"
>
    We proposed a new pipeline to nf-core, initially called STIMULUS (available here: https://github.com/mathysgrapotte/stimulus).
    This pipeline aims to explore ways that deep learning models can learn, relative to how the input data is processed
    (check GitHub or the [`#deepmodeloptim` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07MD07ULR2) on the nf-core slack).

    Working on deepmodeloptim on the hackathon will mostly involve nf-core-izing the pipeline and making it a place where it is easy to contribute.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Sarek (preprocessing) goes GPU"
    category="pipelines"
    leaders={{
        'Furentsu': 'Eugenio Franzoso',
        'famosab': 'Famke Bäuerle'
    }}
    goal="Integration of Parabricks in sarek"
    slack="parabricks"
>
    Variant calling has multiple time consuming steps that could be faster if we use GPUs instead of CPUs.
    First steps to achieve that could be the integration of Parabricks which is software developed by NVIDIA.
    The modules are ready and need to be integrated into sarek.

    This project can also expand onto other pipelines and include more tools that allow execution on GPU.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="nf-core/genomeqc"
    category="pipelines"
    leaders={{
        'chriswyatt1': 'Chris Wyatt',
        'GallVp': 'Usman Rashid',
        'FernandoDuarteF': 'Fernando Duarte',
        'mahesh-panchal': 'Mahesh Binzer-Panchal'
    }}
    goal="Write a first draft of this pipeline"
    slack="genomeqc"
>
    A pipeline to compare and contrast genome assemblies and their annotations.

    When you sequence a new genome, or wish to use a published genome, it is important to gauge the quality of the assembly.
    There are basic tools, such as BUSCO (completeness), QUAST (contiguity), or general statistics of numbers of chromosomes,
    genes, etc (AGAT), but no nf-core pipeline to perform all of these tasks,
    including documenting their TE content, telomere locations, contamination level.

    In addition, we would want to plot this on a phylogenetic tree, to help compare these stats.
    See the [`#genomeqc`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07LY51P4S2) nf-core Slack channel to join!

</HackathonGroup>

## Modules

<HackathonGroup
    title="Image processing pipelines"
    category="modules"
    leaders={{'kbestak': 'Kresimir Bestak'}}
    goal="Work towards next Molkart release and implement an additional MCMICRO segmentation option."
>
    This project focuses on creating modules and adding functionality to (highly multiplexed) imaging pipelines - [nf-core/mcmicro](https://nf-co.re/mcmicro) and [nf-core/molkart](https://nf-co.re/molkart).
    By joining this group you can:
        1) Create new segmentation modules for nf-core/modules (beginner friendly) ...
        2) ... and integrate them into the pipelines (beginner - intermediate level)
        3) Support the spot detection implementation for MCMICRO (intermediate level)
        4) Work on improved QC metric reporting for both pipelines (beginner - intermediate level)
        5) Help us address open [issues](https://github.com/nf-core/molkart/issues) (beginner - intermediate level)

</HackathonGroup>

## Tooling

<HackathonGroup
    title="References"
    category="tooling"
    leaders={{'maxulysse': 'Maxime Garcia', 'pinin4fjords': 'Jonathan Manning'}}
    goal="Replacing iGenomes, then world domination."
    slack="references"
>
    Continuing the discussion from last year's hackathon, this group will work on tasks related to references' genomes handling / management.
    Some work has started with [nf-core/references](https://github.com/nf-core/references) but it is at a very early stage. This hackathon group will work towards agreeing on a fundamental structure and plan.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Tube map polishing"
    category="tooling"
    leaders={{'mashehu': 'Matthias Hörtenhuber'}}
    goal="Make the tube maps in pipelines even more fabulous."
>
    Everybody loves the nf-core tube maps, but they also need some special care to gleam in all their beauty. Come join us and refine your workflows representations to their full glory. Doesn't matter if you already have a finished version and want a thorough review (🦅👀) or brainstorm some ideas and concepts to start a new one, this group is for you. Disclaimer: This will not be an introduction to vector graphic tools. You bring the tools, we bring the eyes and brains.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="nf-test plugins"
    category="tooling"
    leaders={{'nvnieuwk': 'Nicolas Vannieuwkerke'}}
    goal="Fully develop [nft-utils](https://github.com/nf-core/nft-utils) and start new nf-test plugins"
    slack="nft-plugins"
>
    nf-test is a very important piece of our modules, used for continuous integration testing of all our modules.
    However, writing tests for some file types / more advanced tests can be difficult.
    In this group we will try and kickstart the creation of nf-test plugins to make our testing a lot easier.
    This will mainly involve the development of [`nft-utils`](https://github.com/nf-core/nft-utils), the improvement of [`nft-bam`](https://nvnieuwk.github.io/nft-bam/latest/) and hopefully the creation of completely new nf-test plugins.

</HackathonGroup>

## Community

<HackathonGroup
    title="Regulatory"
    category="community"
    leaders={{'apeltzer': 'Alexander Peltzer'}}
    goal="Clearing out the scope of the regulatory special interest group and discussing who would tackle different subfields of the entire regulatory space for future improvements on nf-core guidelines and pipelines."
    slack="regulatory"
>
    This group will work on tasks for the [#regulatory special interest group](/special-interest-groups/regulatory). Most likely we will try to come up with more detailed plans on how to tackle different needs of subgroups within regulatory and try to come up with a strategy on how to both align between those subgroups as well as to come up with plans / proposals for the wider community what we could add to enable e.g. auditors or authorities to understand better what nf-core already provides.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Meta-omics"
    category="community"
    leaders={{'erikrikarddaniel': 'Daniel Lundin', 'jfy133': 'James Fellows Yates'}}
    goal="Widened understanding of the implementation details of all pipelines in a larger group of developers."
    slack="meta-omics"
>
    We will work on meta-omics pipelines -- mag, ampliseq, metatdenovo, magmap, eager and taxprofiler --
    how they can be made to better integrate with each other plus a number of downstream pipelines.

    Working on deepmodeloptim on the hackathon will mostly involve nf-core-izing the pipeline and making it a place where it is easy to contribute.

</HackathonGroup>

# Social activities

During the hackathon, we will have light-hearted fun and games!
Special prizes are up for grabs for the winners!

More details will be revelealed at the start of the event, but you can expect: a quiz, bingo and sock-related activities.
