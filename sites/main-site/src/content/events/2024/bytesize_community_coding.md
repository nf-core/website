Collaboration is central to the nf-core experience.
Developing pipelines with a community has many benefits, but can also be tricky coordinate across multiple people, from multiple group, and even across multiple continents.

In this bytesize James Fellows Yates ([@jfy133](https://github.com/jfy133)) will summarise some of his thoughts from developing, adopting, and maintaining 5 different nf-core pipelines both solo and in teams.
He will give suggestions on the ways he has found effective to attract and keep momentum when developing pipelines with the community.
Hopefully the tips will inspire and assist others to start or expand their community-based pipeline development teams.
