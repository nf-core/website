nf-core/differentialabundance is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse data represented as matrices, comparing groups of observations to generate differential statistics and downstream analyses, see more [here](https://nf-co.re/differentialabundance/1.4.0). In this weeks bytesize, Jonathan Manning ([pinin4fjords](https://github.com/pinin4fjords)) will show us the ins and outs of the nf-core/differentialabundance pipeline.
