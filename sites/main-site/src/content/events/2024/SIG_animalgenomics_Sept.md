September 2024 talk of the monthly meeting of the _#animal-genomics_ special interest group.
In this talk, **Guillaume Devailly** (INRAE, France) together with **Cervin Guyomar** (INRAE, France) and **Sandrine Lagarrigue** (Institut Agro-INRAE, France) presented **Automatic visualisation of FAANG data**:

<div class="mx-2">The FAANG data portal offers a great curation of transcriptomic and epigenomic data from livestock species. We would like to improve FAANG data re-use by offering automatic visualisations of available datasets: sample - sample correlation heatmaps, genomic stacks at interesting features (peak center, transcription start site, CpG island, ...). We therefore need to automatically process FAANG dataset using a Nextflow pipeline and could provide uniformly processed files and QC reports as useful artifacts. While an initial protoype is available, help is needed to sustain this development.</div>
