Kickoff meeting of the regulatory special interest group. The new nf-core ["Regulatory" special interest group](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/regulatory) is intended to bring people together to discuss topics around pipeline validation and qualification for clinical applications. We hope to make key nf-core pipelines even more complete in terms of testing, adherence to standards and documentation. By bringing different stakeholders with interests in validation & qualification together, we aim to improve standards and fill gaps with respect to FDA/EMA requirements.

We intend to outline some points that we could potentially tackle, identify what others are considering the regulatory space and how far we are in terms of making nf-core pipelines even more complete and what would be necessary to achieve this.

The kickoff will have a structured agenda of potential points but everyone is welcome to contribute and chime in with their own remarks and experience on the matter.
