# Welcome

Join us from **March 5-6** for the Community Nextflow Foundational Training event!

The training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow.
While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) for the first time.

Prior knowledge of Nextflow is not required but will make it easier to understand new concepts.

# Before the event

The workshop will utilize a [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) environment that contains all the software and data required for this workshop. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account is required to access this environment. It may take several minutes to register for GitHub and GitPod for the first time and it's recommended that participants have preregistered for both before the event.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nf-core).
