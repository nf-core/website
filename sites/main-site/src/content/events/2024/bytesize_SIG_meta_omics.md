In this week's bytesize Daniel Lundin ([@erikrikarddaniel](https://github.com/erikrikarddaniel)), James A. Fellows Yates ([@jfy133](https://github.com/jfy133)) and Carson J. Miller ([@carsonjm](https://github.com/carsonjm)) introduce the [Special Interest Group "meta-omics"](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/meta-omics).
This group is a place to discuss the subject around _meta_ genomics, _meta_ taxonomics, _meta_ barcoding, _meta_ transcriptomics, _meta_ proteomics and all other _meta_ omics - basically any field that aims to study more than a single organism at the same time. Some of the pipelines that would fall into this Special Interest Group are nf-core/ampliseq, nf-core/taxprofiler, nf-core/mag, nf-core/metatdenovo, and nf-core/magmap, amongst others.
