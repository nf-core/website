# Welcome

Join us in person for the May 2024 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2024**_ in Boston, America üá∫üá∏.
You can find out more information about the summit at https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/boston/.

The Boston nf-core hackathon will be in-person only, without the hybrid / online features that we have used in other events (e.g., Gather Town).
Anyone is free to join remotely, as we will be using the same GitHub Project boards and Slack communication as usual.
However, please be aware, we won't actively be trying to run this as a hybrid event.

# Venue: Aloft Boston Seaport District

The hackathon will be taking place in at the [Aloft Boston Seaport District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5MggV9yLqsTqoSgXA)

More information about this venue can be found on the [Nextflow Summit website](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/boston/).

# Pre-hackathon checklist

Ensure you have read/signed up/joined/installed the following resources before the hackathon.

-   Check you agree with the [Code of Conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct) of the event
-   If you haven't already, set up a GitHub account and [join the nf-core GitHub organization](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
-   Join the nf-core slack and the [#hackathon-may-2024 channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C074MJ1PLKA)
-   Have [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/), [nf-core/tools](https://nf-co.re/tools/#installation), and one of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), Singularity, or [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)/[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your computer
-   Familiarize yourself with the [documentation on the nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/docs)

# How to hack!

We will be a lot of people working in parallel during this hackathon, so to stay organized we have a recommended workflow:

1. :speech_balloon: Chat with your group to get an overview of what is going on.
2. <i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Join the relevant Slack channel(s) to stay up to date and discuss with your project members.

    - [#hackathon-may-2024](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C074MJ1PLKA) **(everyone should join this channel)**
    - [#hackathon-may-2024-nf-test](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C074BEKHFMF)
    - [#hackathon-may-2024-pipelines](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C074BETFN0H)
    - [#hackathon-may-2024-modules](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C073YLY2YQK)
    - [#hackathon-may-2024-infrastructure](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C073S5Z9YNA)

3. <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Find a task to work on using the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/65/views/1).
   - If you have something you want to do that's not there, please make an issue and add it to the board.
4. üôã Assign yourself to the issue that you're currently working on (preferably one issue at a time).
    - This is so that multiple people don't accidentally work on the same task.
5. :fast_forward: When you're done, make a pull request with your changes.
    - Link it to the issue so that the issue closes when merged.
6. :page_facing_up: Describe your work on the Google slides for the project and tell the group! :tada:
7. :memo: While waiting to receive a review - try reviewing someone else's PR!
    - [Module review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#new-module-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
    - [Subworkflow review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/subworkflows#new-subworkflow-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
8. :recycle: Repeat!

# Topics

The hackathon is a great opportunity to work on any nf-core related work that you have been putting off or didn't have time for.
To help you find like-minded people or possible things to work on, we will have the following topics (formally known as groups):

<HackathonGroup title="nf-test" color="#238636" leaders={{
    'adamrtalbot': 'Adam Talbot'
}}>
    The nf-test group will focus on implementing nf-test within nf-core modules, subworkflows, and pipelines.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Adding nf-test to existing pipelines
    - Adding nf-test to modules
    - Adding nf-test to subworkflows
    - Improving nf-test documentation and the nf-core documentation on testing

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines" color="#bf4b8a" leaders={{
    'maxulysse': 'Maxime Garcia'
}}>
    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test within pipelines
    - Adding new functionality to existing pipelines
    - Updating pipelines to use the latest nf-core template, via template syncs
    - Teams formed around work on specific pipelines

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Modules & Subworkflows" color="#1f6feb" leaders={{
    'FloWuenne': 'Florian Wuennemann'
}}>
    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows
    at [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test for modules
    - Creating new modules, see issue list
    - Stubs for all modules

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Infrastructure" color="#9e6a03" leaders={{
    'edmundmiller': 'Edmund Miller'
}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
    If you'd like to make a difference to nf-core without writing any Nextflow code,
    this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Subworkflows nf-core/tools infrastructure
    - Template customisation with feature flags
    - Stripped down/customisable nf-core pipeline template
    - New nf-core website features (if you have some expierence with modern JavaScript or want to learn)
    - Improve the devOps for nf-core (GitHub actions, CI/CD, etc.)
    - Add Bioconda ARM support

</HackathonGroup>
