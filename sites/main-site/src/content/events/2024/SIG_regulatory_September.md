First regular meeting of the regulatory special interest group after the kickoff. The main intent is now to generate some structured documentation on what would be open topics of interest to the various stakeholders and (sub-) groups inside regulatory: Clinical applications, trial/study applications, (companion) diagnostics for example have different needs and requirements and should not be treated in the same way: This is the scope of this meetup to try and figure out where is common ground while pushing for potential ways to get something practically shaped within the special interest group. We will share an agenda based on input from the kick off and then could start planning with the community what would be feasible things to tackle first and how to make this hopefully a success.
