December 2024 talk of the monthly meeting of the [_#animal-genomics_ special interest group](/special-interest-groups/animal-genomics).
During this meeting **Emily Clark** (The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, UK) presented:

[_The Elixir Domestic Animals Genome and Phenome Focus Group_](elixir-europe.org/focus-groups/domestic-animals-genome-phenome)

<div class="mx-2">A new ELIXIR Focus Group has been created in the area of domestic animal genomics and phenomics research. The group will promote and align tools, databases, standards and best practices, and consider the case for the formation of an ELIXIR Community. Along with the recently formed Pathogens Data Focus Group, the Domestic Animals Genome and Phenome Focus Group advances the ELIXIR Programme focus area “Biodiversity, Food Security and Pathogens”. The new Focus Group will support genotype to phenotype analysis for farmed and companion animal species by connecting researchers and data scientists across species and countries and developing a coordinated, open and standardised data life cycle. We are currently developing a white paper describing the Domestic Animals Genome and Phenome Community and I will provide more details about the scope and how to contribute to this in the presentation.</div>
