October 2024 talk of the monthly meeting of the _#animal-genomics_ special interest group featured **Roderic Guigó** (CRG). In this session, Dr. Guigó discussed the annotation of the human and mouse genomes, announcing that the day after the presentation, the new GENCODE release would reveal an expanded annotation of 40,000 lncRNA genes, doubling the size of annotated lncRNA (the greatest increase in GENCODE's twenty-year history). He explains how this annotation was carried out and some interesting features of the annotated regions but watch the video if you want to learn more.
