In this week's bytesize, Cedric Notredame, Björn ([@bjlang](https://github.com/bjlang)), Francesca Bernini and Jose ([@JoseEspinosa](https://github.com/JoseEspinosa)) are introducing the nf-core [special interest group "Animal Genomics"](https://nf-co.re/special-interest-groups/animal-genomics). This group aims to be a hub for animal genomics researchers to come together and discuss best practices for running nf-core pipelines efficiently in their field and get inspiration from talks of other researchers in the field and beyond. The speakers will give an overview of how the group started before converting to an nf-core special interest group, what it is about, what it has done already and its future perspective.
