[Superfluid Dx](https://www.superfluiddx.com/) is excited to host us for our hackathon! They are located in the heart of SF biotech in South San Francisco. We will have access to a nice space on the 5th floor of the building where their office is (building 259). Please register by no later than 3/14 via the main nf-core hackathon page, as we will need to know attendee info to get everyone into the building. More logistical details coming soon!
