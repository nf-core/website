# Registration

Registration is closed for this event.

## Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather.
If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

To join, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Follow [this link](https://app.gather.town/app/br78S294XBCL487A/nf-core-hackathon) to find the Gather space
    - Please note that the hackathon space will not open until the event
2. Enter the email address you used to register for the hackathon
    - This is the same address from which you received this email
3. Check your email for a one-time code and enter it into the Gather window
4. Enter the space and enjoy the hackathon!

:::info{title="Help! I can't access the space!"}
We will create a safe list of registered participants that will be able to access the hackathon space. Please check which email you used to register for the event. If you still have issues accessing the space, please contact the [organizers on Slack](https://nfcore.slack.com/team/U024MM1DRKL).
:::

## In person: Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2024 we hope to replicate and build on that success! 🚀

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

:::info{title="Reminder"}
Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.

# Pre-hackathon checklist

Ensure you have read/signed up/joined/installed the following resources before the hackathon.

-   Check you agree with the [Code of Conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct) of the event
-   If you haven't already, set up a GitHub account and [join the nf-core GitHub organization](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
-   Join the nf-core slack and the [#hackathon-mar-2024 channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06GNCNARS5)
-   Create a Gather account using the email you used to register (see above)
-   Have [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/), [nf-core/tools](https://nf-co.re/tools/#installation), and one of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), Singularity, or [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)/[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your computer
-   Familiarize yourself with the [documentation on the nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/docs)

# How to hack!

We will be a lot of people working in parallel during this hackathon, so to stay organized we have a recommended workflow:

1. :speech_balloon: Chat with your group (on slack or gather town) to get an overview of what is going on.
2. <i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Join the relevant Slack channel(s) to stay up to date and discuss with your project members.

    - [Beginners channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06NEGANQ2J)
    - [Infrastructure channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06P9UX9T5W)
    - [Modules & subworkflows channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06P9UP3K4G)
    - [nf-test channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06NPK4J2GL)
    - [Pipelines channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06NM5GDP5Y)
    - [Training materials channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06NM2HM6MR)
    - [Scavenger hunt channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06P39LTE4W)

3. <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Find a task to work on using the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/65/views/1).
   - If you have something you want to do that's not there, please make an issue and add it to the board.
4. :raising_hand: Assign yourself to the issue that you're currently working on (preferably one issue at a time).
    - This is so that multiple people don't accidentally work on the same task.
5. :fast_forward: When you're done, make a pull request with your changes.
    - Link it to the issue so that the issue closes when merged.
6. :page_facing_up: Describe your work on the HackMD document for the project and tell the group! :tada:
7. :memo: While waiting to receive a review - try reviewing someone else's PR!
    - [Module review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#new-module-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
    - [Subworkflow review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/subworkflows#new-subworkflow-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
8. :recycle: Repeat!

# Topics

The hackathon is a great opportunity to work on any nf-core related work that you have been putting off or didn't have time for. To help you find like-minded people or possible things to work on, we will have the following topics (formally known as groups):

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners" intro_video="dhgUFU8iqGk" leaders={{'mribeirodantas': 'Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas'}}>

    For people who are new to nf-core (but not necessarily new to Nextflow) and need a bit of guidance on where to start.

    > Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of working with Nextflow.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="nf-test" color="#238636" intro_video="LcdKhFjAWmU" leaders={{
    'nvnieuwk': 'Nicolas Vannieuwkerke',
    'sateeshperi': 'Sateesh Peri'
}}>
    The nf-test group will focus on implementing nf-test within nf-core modules, subworkflows, and pipelines.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Adding nf-test to existing pipelines
    - Adding nf-test to modules
    - Adding nf-test to subworkflows
    - Improving nf-test documentation and the nf-core documentation on testing

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines" color="#bf4b8a" intro_video="tpk7O7W12r0" leaders={{
    'FriederikeHanssen': 'Friederike Hanssen',
    'JoseEspinosa': 'Jose Espinosa-Carrasco',
    'maxulysse': 'Maxime Garcia',
    'subwaystation': 'Simon Heumos',
    'LaurenceKuhl': 'Laurence Kuhlburger'
}}>
    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test within pipelines
    - Adding new functionality to existing pipelines
    - Updating pipelines to use the latest nf-core template, via template syncs
    - Teams formed around work on specific pipelines

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Modules & Subworkflows" color="#1f6feb" intro_video="tXHzj0nWDXE" leaders={{
    'maxulysse': 'Maxime Garcia',
    'jonasscheid': 'Jonas Scheid',
    'JoseEspinosa': 'Jose Espinosa-Carrasco'
}}>
    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows
    at [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test for modules
    - Creating new modules, see issue list
    - Stubs for all modules

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Infrastructure" color="#9e6a03" intro_video="WOSBpHTM2nQ" leaders={{
    'mashehu': 'Matthias Hörtenhuber',
}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
    If you'd like to make a difference to nf-core without writing any Nextflow code,
    this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Subworkflows nf-core/tools infrastructure
    - Template customisation with feature flags
    - Stripped down/customisable nf-core pipeline template
    - New nf-core website features (if you have some expierence with modern JavaScript or want to learn)
    - Improve the devOps for nf-core (GitHub actions, CI/CD, etc.)
    - Add Bioconda ARM support

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Training materials" intro_video="PsT8uFKOeFA" leaders={{
    'FranBonath': 'Franziska Bonath',
}}>
    We are always looking for ways to improve our training materials.
    If you have ideas for new content, or would like to help improve existing content, this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:
    - Test and improve existing training materials
    - Create new training materials

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Online"
    leaders={{
        yuukiiwa: "Yuk Kei",
    }}
>
    If you're feeling lost in Gather.town, or just want to hang out with other online attendees, look out for Yuk Kei.
    She'll be able to steer you in the right direction and get you started with one of the project groups.
