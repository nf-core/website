If you used the stairs from the main hall of the building, head to the fourth floor and turn left, until the end of the cooridor.
You will then find only one door on your right: pass the door and go straigh to the end of the new corridor. The lab is on the left.

## Organisational Information

There is a cafeteria close by - [La Bouvette dell'Ingegnere](https://www.instagram.com/labouvetteunipv/), which accepts both card and cash.
