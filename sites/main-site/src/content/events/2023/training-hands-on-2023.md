# Welcome

Join us from September 20 2023 for the Hands-on Nextflow & nf-core Training event!

The Hands-on Nextflow training is entirely virtual and free and will demonstrate how to build a pipeline with Nextflow. While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who have already completed the foundational Nextflow training.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [Hands-on Nextflow training playlist on the nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3xpfTVZLcNiCJRgKnBFYtmnXj1U31szQ).

# Schedule

This training session will be available from 3 p.m. (CEST) on September 20th. This session will be approximately 2 hours.
