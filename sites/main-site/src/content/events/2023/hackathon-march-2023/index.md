# Welcome

Join us online March 27-29, 2023, for the nf-core hackathon! 🗓️

The nf-core hackathon is free and is being held online (we will be back in [Gather](https://gather.town/)).
Some community members are also hosting [local sites](#local-events).
We will do our best to support people in all time zones. :earth_americas: :earth_asia: :earth_africa:

# Gather access

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather. If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

To join, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Follow [this link](https://app.gather.town/app/br78S294XBCL487A/nf-core-hackathon) to find the Gather space
   - Please note that the hackathon space will not open until the event
2. Enter the email address you used to register for the hackathon
   - This is the same address from which you received this email
3. Check your email for a one-time code and enter it into the Gather window
4. Enter the space and enjoy the hackathon!

# Local sites

We are trying something new! 🚀

Hacking in person is a lot of fun. Although the hackathon is online, to get the best of both worlds, we are encouraging everyone to create local sites where people can gather to hack together. Be it with your group, institute, city, or region, local sites will be a lot of fun!

If you have registered for a local site your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your local site organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

> Reminder: Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.

# Pre-hackathon checklist

Ensure you have read/signed up/joined/installed the following resources before the hackathon.

- Check you agree with the [Code of Conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct) of the event
- If you haven’t already, set up a GitHub account and [join the nf-core GitHub organization](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
- Join the nf-core slack and the [#hackathon-march-2023 channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04U29Y97SB)
- Create a Gather account using the email you used to register (see above)
- Have [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/), [nf-core/tools](/docs/nf-core-tools/installation), and one of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), Singularity, or [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)/[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your computer
- Familiarize yourself with the [documentation on the nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/docs)

# How to hack!

We will be a lot of people working in parallel during this hackathon, so to stay organized we have a recommended workflow:

1. :speech_balloon: Chat with your group (on slack or gather town) to get an overview of what is going on.
2. <i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Join the relevant Slack channel(s) to stay up to date and discuss with your project members.
   - [Documentation channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04UGQXUK2N)
   - [Infrastructure channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04V6FR8LN4)
   - [Pipelines channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04UK9FMKN0)
   - [Modules channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04UA7FFWES)
   - [Subworkflows channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C04UGMMT3JP)
3. <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Find a task to work on using the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/38/views/16).
   - If you have something you want to do that's not there, please make an issue and add it to the board.
4. :raising_hand: Assign yourself to the issue that you're currently working on (preferably one issue at a time).
   - This is so that multiple people don't accidentally work on the same task.
5. :fast_forward: When you're done, make a pull request with your changes.
   - Link it to the issue so that the issue closes when merged.
6. :page_facing_up: Describe your work on the HackMD document for the project and tell the group! :tada:
7. :memo: While waiting to receive a review - try reviewing someone else's PR!
   - [Module review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#new-module-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
   - [Subworkflow review checklist](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/subworkflows#new-subworkflow-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist)
8. :recycle: Repeat!

> The HackMD document is the easiest to forget, but please add something even if you think what you did was small -
> we will use it in the group check-outs for each day and also in the reporting after the event so it's important for us :bow:

See below for an introduction on how to use the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/38):

# Groups

To keep things manageable everyone will be organized into groups.
You are free to change groups at any time during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/38).
There is a separate tab for each group that will have a list of relevant issues for you to work on.

### Time zones

If you're in APAC (Asia / Pacific) or AMER (Americas) and can't find anyone, message the group leaders below.
They will be online all day and can get you started.

This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline, or an entirely new pipeline (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon, following [our guidelines](/docs/tutorials/adding_a_pipeline/overview#before-you-start)). These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.
