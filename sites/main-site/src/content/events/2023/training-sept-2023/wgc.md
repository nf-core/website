# Welcome

This is a free local event to be held at the [Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge](https://goo.gl/maps/XA8caWCAVToVT6EeA).

Registration for the in person Wellcome Genome Campus event is now closed.

If you have any questions about this event please reach out to [Priyanka Surana](mailto:ps22@sanger.ac.uk).

# Local Schedule

This full-day event will run from **9.30 am - 5.00 pm BST**.

The schedule for the in-person Wellcome Genome Campus event will differ from the schedule shown for the online event.
The same content will be covered at both events, however, the content will be condensed into one day rather than spread across two.

The training material will be presented virtually by Seqera Labs bioinformatics engineer [Rob Syme](https://github.com/robsyme). Tentative schedule for the day is listed below.
