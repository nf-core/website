# Welcome

Join us from September 27-28 2023 for the Community Advanced Nextflow Training event!

The Community Advanced Nextflow Training is virtual and free. It will explore the advanced features of the Nextflow language and runtime, and how to use them to write efficient and scalable data-intensive workflows. We will cover topics such as parallel execution, error handling, and workflow customization. By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to create complex and powerful Nextflow pipelines for your own data analysis projects.

Please note that this is not an introductory workshop and experience writing Nextflow pipelines is assumed.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [Advanced Nextflow training playlist on the nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3xpfTVZLcNhPoEl8cT15MdIBfX9kFJCj).

A link to each stream will also be posted in the [`#sept23-advanced-training`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C05U1A096EQ) Slack channel.
