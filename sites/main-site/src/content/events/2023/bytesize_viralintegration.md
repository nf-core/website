nf-core/viralintegration is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for the identification of viral integration events in genomes using a chimeric read approach. It was initially based on the [CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder](https://github.com/broadinstitute/CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder). Alyssa Briggs ([@alyssa-ab](https://github.com/alyssa-ab)) will introduce us to nf-core/viralintegration by showing it's use cases.
