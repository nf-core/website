The last hackathon was under the unoffical theme of "adopting nf-test". Adam ([@adamrtalbot](https://github.com/adamrtalbot)) and Sateesh ([@sateeshperi](https://github.com/sateeshperi)) are going to show in this bytesize how to convert a pytest module to nf-test. Although this may be soon a feature of future nf-core/tools, you will get a look into the steps required to do so on your own!

The PR with the changes done during this bytesize can be found [here](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/4250).
