nf-core/pangenome is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for pangenome graph construction. The pipeline renders a collection of sequences into a pangenome graph with the goal to to build a graph that is locally directed and acyclic while preserving large-scale variation. Simon Heumos ([@subwaystation](https://github.com/subwaystation)) is going to show us the ins and outs of this pipeline.
