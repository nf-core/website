# Regular time slots

We run 3 weekly helpdesk slots for different regions / time zones:

- AMER: Tuesdays 2pm ET _(<LocalDateTime date={(() => { const d = nextTuesday(new Date()); return new TZDate(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate(), 14, 0, 'America/New_York'); })()} date_options={{ hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit" }} showTimezone={true} client:load />)_
- APAC: Wednesdays 3pm NZDT _(<LocalDateTime date={(() => { const d = nextWednesday(new Date()); return new TZDate(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate(), 15, 0, 'Pacific/Auckland'); })()} date_options={{ hour: "2-digit", minute: "2-digit" }} showTimezone={true} client:load />)_

:::tip
Weekly helpdesk sessions are run on a best-effort basis, depending on volunteer availability.
Check the [`#weekly-helpdesk` Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06KSS9L8M7) for the latest info.
:::

In these sessions, some of the nf-core maintainer team and other seasoned community members
will be available to engage in discussions about your code, running pipelines,
writing configs, or anything else related to nf-core and Nextflow.
They will hang out in Gather during designated hours every week,
ready to provide guidance and insights or just chat about your favourite pipeline.

Helpdesk sessions won't be structured.

Things that might be discussed include:

- A specific concept doesn't make sense and you'd like to talk it over
- You're working on a component or pipeline, you're stuck, and you'd like to get unstuck
- You'd like to swap code reviews with someone to get your PR merged
- You'd like to write an institution config and like some insights
- You can't figure out how to run a pipeline
- You want to hang out with other Nextflow enthusiasts and get to know the faces behind the slack handles

The Helpdesk hours will take place in [Gather](https://gather.town/),
an online collaborate platform, kind of like Pokemon-meets-Zoom.
You can join by following the Gather Town link [here](https://nf-co.re/join#gather-town).
For more information, see the [Gather Town bytesize talk](/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown).

Please join the [#weekly-helpdesk](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/weekly-helpdesk) channel on the nf-core Slack to get reminders when sessions are about to start.
