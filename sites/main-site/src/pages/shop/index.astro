                <p class="card-text small">
                    When you buy something, Spreadshirt will print and ship the product to you. This means we don't have
                    to hold any inventory in stock, or really do anything. The entire shop runs directly with
                    Spreadshirt.

                <h5>Does nf-core make a profit?</h5>
                <p class="card-text small">
                    No, we have set the profit margin to zero, everything is at cost price. This means everything is as
                    cheap as possible, and also saves us from having to navigate legal / tax headaches.

                <p class="card-text small">
                    There are two shops, one in the US and one in the EU. Plus, many locales. Pick the one closest to
                    you to use your local currency and get the best shipping.
