 *
 * There are some cases where Index-Free queries are not guaranteed to produce
 * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, the

 *
 * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer
 *   matches the query.
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below
 *   another document that is in the local cache.

     * are fatal.

     * Consequently the fallback is handled internally here in start, and if the
