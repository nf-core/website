subtitle: Guidelines for crediting people's contributions
---

Here we outline, how to credit the work of others as it is incorporated into your pipeline. It is important and critical that we acknowledge those who support our work.

## In scripts

If the original concept of your script or parts of the code are borrowed, please acknowledge with a comment at the top.

```
# This script is based on https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/bin/check_samplesheet.py
or
# This script was originally conceived by @github-username
```

## In `README.md`

Under `Credits` in `README.md`

- Acknowledge those who wrote the scripts and local modules
- Acknowledge those who provide concepts and ideas
- Acknowledge the code reviewers and those who contributed through discussions
- Acknowledge nf-core and Nextflow Slack community members for answering queries

## In `CITATIONS.md`

List all pipeline tools with links and references.
