# Welcome

Please join us for the October 2022 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2022**_ in Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸. You can find out more information about the summit at <https://summit.nextflow.io>. Registration for the event will open in early July together with registration for the summit.

In addition to the in-person event, we will endeavour to run a hybrid option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of nextflow and/or nf-core. If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there will be free online workshops spanning all global timezones in the week before the hackathon. For more information and the training registration link, see the [Nextflow and nf-core training event page](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/training-october-2022).

# Registration

Registration is now open together with the Nextflow Summit: <https://summit.nextflow.io/register>

You can register for either the hackathon or the summit, or both. You're welcome to attend in-person or online.
Attendance online is free, attending in person costs €49 (€59 incl. VAT).

Registration will close September 9th, 2022.

# Groups

To keep work and discussion during the hackathon manageable, we will organise everyone into groups.
You are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.

Since the Nextflow Summit is going to be held just after the hackathon, we decided to keep presentations to a minimum. There will however be some workshops. More details about those will be given closer to the event.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub _project board_ (we'll post a link to here closer to the time). There will be a separate tab for each group where will have collated a list of relevant issues.

## Group 1 - Documentation

This group will focus on all kind of documentation, from pipelines themselves to modules and general documentation to aid in getting started with nf-core and Nextflow. We are also planning on making introduction videos for each pipeline.

## Group 2 - Subworkflows

Why stop at sharing modules, we want to share subworkflows between pipelines too! Join this group to work on the cutting edge of nf-core development, fleshing out details about how this functionality will work and building proof of concept code to use as a model for the rest of nf-core. Recommended for relatively experienced Nextflow / nf-core contributors only.

## Group 3 - Pipelines

This group will focus on any pipeline related work, this could be:

- DSL2 conversion of a pipeline
- New / improved features for a pipeline
- Entirely new pipelines

## Group 4 - Modules

This group will welcome anyone who wants to work on new modules or improve existing ones.

## Group 5 - Central tools / Website

The nf-core website is in desperate need of work, and central tooling always needs to be improved and maintained. If this sounds like a fun task, join group 5!

# Community Streaming Events

Community streaming events are a great way to engage with your local communities while participating in events remotely. By simply booking a room and gathering your colleagues you can create discussion and build your community while enjoying the training, nf-core Hackathon, and/or Nextflow Summit together.

If this is somethign you are interested in you can tell us about your plans using the link below. We will send you extra material to help you prepare and promote your local event. To get started we have a [poster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQDtrVUv1Lro5lZFmeyfaPgJUI2pmGojtL9tWlQiVyQ/edit) that you can download, edit, and share. We have also created a dedicated [`#community-stream-events`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C03Q3RE0RJQ) Slack channel where you can ask questions and share information about your event.

Keep an eye out for others hosting community events in your area. We will be sharing information about community events and how to get in contact with hosts on our website.

You can add your community event using [this link](https://seqera.typeform.com/streaming-event).

# COVID control

Please remember that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over.
If you intend on joining the hackathon in person, we request that you get vaccinated and tested, if possible. We ask for anyone who displays symptoms to not mingle with other participants. Whilst it is not feasible for us to enforce any rules, we request that attendees behave responsibly.

We will be monitoring the status of the pandemic as the event draws closer and reserve the right to make changes in our policies if we deem that to be necessary.
