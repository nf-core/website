# Welcome

Join us online March 27-29 2023 for the nf-core hackathon! 🗓️

The nf-core hackathon is free and is being held online (we will be back in [gather.town](https://gather.town/)).
Some community members are also hosting [local sites](#local-events).
We will do our best to support people in all time zones. :earth_americas: :earth_asia: :earth_africa:

Please note this is not a training event. More information about our community training event, being held March 13-16 2023, can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-march-2023).

## Local events

We are trying something new! 🚀

Hacking in person is a lot of fun. Although the hackathon is online, to get the best of both worlds, we are encouraging everyone to create local sites where people can gather to hack together. Be it with your group, institute, city, or region, local sites will be a lot of fun!

Some sites have limits for the number of people they can host - please register early so you don't miss out on attending a local site.
Also, if you have registered for a local but can no longer attend please let us know so we can free your space for someone else who might want to attend.

Please view the event page above for location-specific information. Also, if you intend to attend a local site, make sure you select it during your registration so the local host knows you will be attending.

If there is no event near you, don't worry - everyone is welcome to join online!

## Hosting an event

Hosting a local event can be as simple as booking a room and telling your friends!

If you are interested in adding a local site, please put in a pull request to edit this page and add the details of your event so that others can find you. Also, let the nf-core outreach team know as soon as possible so we can add your site to the registration form, mail you some goodies, and help you with the organization.

## Groups

To keep things manageable everyone will be organized into groups.
You are free to change groups at any time during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub project board (we'll post a link here closer to the time).
There will be a separate tab for each group that will have a list of relevant issues for you to work on.

#### Documentation

The documentation group will focus on all things documentation related, from pipelines themselves to modules and general documentation to aid in getting started with nf-core and Nextflow. This is a great group to start if you are not sure where to begin.

#### Infrastructure

The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved. If you enjoy working with python or want to do some web development (mainly CSS and javascript - we are using astrojs+svelte), join the infrastructure group!

#### Pipelines

The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work. This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline, or an entirely new pipeline (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon, following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)). These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

#### Modules

The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

#### Subworkflows

Why stop at only sharing modules? [Subworkflows](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) can be shared between pipelines too! Join the subworkflows group to work on this new nf-core development!

## Schedule

We expect people to come and go during the hackathon due to diverse time zones. Please do whatever works best for you!

The full schedule for the nf-core hackathon will be available very soon...

## How we will work

We will be a lot of people working in parallel during this hackathon, so to stay organized we have a recommended workflow:

1. :speech_balloon: Chat with your group (on slack or gather town) to get an overview of what is going on.
2. <i class="fab fa-slack"></i> Join the relevant Slack channel(s) to stay up to date and discuss with your project members (channels will be made available closer to the event).
3. <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Find a task to work on using the GitHub Project Board (the board will be made available closer to the event).
4. :raising_hand: Assign yourself to the issue that you're currently working on (preferably one issue at a time).
5. :fast_forward: When you're done, make a pull request with your changes. Link it to the issue so that the issue closes when merged.
6. :page_facing_up: Describe your work on the HackMD document for the project and tell the group! :tada:
7. :recycle: Repeat!

> The HackMD document is the easiest to forget, but please add something even if you think what you did was small -
> we will use it in the group check-outs for each day and also in the reporting after the event so it's important for us :bow:
