# Welcome

Save the date and join us for the March 2023 nf-core hackathon!

This event is virtual (we will be back in [gather.town](https://gather.town/)!).
We will do our best to support people in all timezones. :earth_americas: :earth_asia: :earth_africa:

## Local events

For this hackathon, we will try something new 🚀
Hacking in-person is a lot of fun. So to get the best of both worlds, we are encouraging everyone to create small local groups, be it with your friends, colleagues, institute, or geographical region.
Once sat together, join the global gathering online, on gather.town together.

Watch this space for more details in the coming weeks!
