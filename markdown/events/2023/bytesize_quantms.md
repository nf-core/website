# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/quantms

This week, Yasset and Julianus will introduce to us the nf-core pipeline quantms. nf-core/quantms is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for Quantitative Mass Spectrometry (MS). Currently, the workflow supports three major MS-based analytical methods: Data dependant acquisition (DDA), either (i) label-free or (ii) Isobaric quantitation (e.g. TMT, iTRAQ) and (iii) Data independent acquisition (DIA) with label-free quantification.
More information about nf-core/quantms can be found on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/quantms)
