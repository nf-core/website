# Welcome

Join us from September 6-8 2023 for the Community Nextflow & nf-core Training event!

The Community Nextflow and nf-core Training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core. While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nf-core).

# Schedule

Training sessions will be available from 3 pm (CEST) each day. Each session will be approximately 3 hours and will include a short break.

The schedule for each session will be availble soon!

## Asking questions

Questions can be asked in the Slack channels created for this event. Community volunteers will monitor these channels and will answer your questions as quickly as they can. You can join the nf-core Slack [here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack).
