In this talk, I want to first explain what nf-core [1] is and the place it has in the Nextflow [2] ecosystem. I will then show what it does well and what it doesn't do well, together with some potential workarounds, and try to clarify the roles and responsibilities of everyone (end-users, contributors, maintainers, etc).
