description: Accepted practices for corporate involvement in the nf-core community
---

This page is intended for anyone coming to the Nextflow and nf-core community when representing a company or corporate interest.

Firstly - welcome! We are an open and inclusive community and encourage everyone to be involved. Here we try to set out some guidelines to act as guard-rails for activity, both for the benefit of community members but also so that you feel comfortable that you are interacting with the community in acceptable ways.

## Code of conduct

The [code of conduct](/code_of_conduct/) applies to everyone active in the community.
Two points are particularly worth highlighting, which are not allowed:

- Sending unsolicited direct-messages or emails to community members on Slack / other platforms
- Posting in nf-core spaces specifically to criticise or detract from Nextflow and nf-core, and to promote alternatives

Contravening these, or any of the behaviours listed in the code of conduct, will likely result in an immediate ban.

## Slack channels

Please refrain from posting about your products and services in Slack, with some exceptions:

- The `#shameless-promo` channel
  - This channel is designed specifically for promotion of personal and commercial projects relevant to the nf-core community
  - "Relevant" means that a significant chunk of the people reading the message may find it useful for their daily work.
  - See above code of conduct points. Posting that tool X is better than Nextflow / nf-core and advertising an alterative is not ok.
- In reply to active discussions
  - If your tool or product is relevant to an ongoing discussion, it's ok to mention it.
  - For example: _"The things you're trying to achieve can be done with tool XXX, let me know if you would like more details."_
  - Please use common sense: don't swamp the thread and push too hard.

Posts that the nf-core core team / safety team deem to violate these principles will be deleted, and the authors may be banned.

If in doubt, please reach out to one of the [core team](/governance#core-team) to ask if your idea is ok or not.

## Slack direct messages

Unsolicited direct messages (DMs) are explicitly forbidden in our community.

For example, sending DMs to community members such as the following is _not_ ok:

> Hi XXX! I work at YYY and we're building the future of computational biology.
> We're launching a new tool and are looking for beta testers, and you seem
> to match the profile that we're looking for. Please let us know if you'd
> like us to sign you up!

Please use public channels such as `#shameless-promo` instead of doing this.

The only time that it's acceptable to reach out to a community member via DM is if you have been discussing something with that person in a public channel and they have shown explicit interest. You may then follow up with them via a DM.

Please try to keep as much discussion in public channels as possible.

## Job adverts

Feel free to post any job adverts into the `#jobs` Slack channel.
