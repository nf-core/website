subtitle: Specifications for writing any nf-core component

nf-core aims to produce high-quality Nextflow pipelines.

An important part of this is the use of community-agreed-upon standardised components that follow 'best-practises'.

The following pages describe the specifications of standardised nf-core components:

- [Test data](/docs/contributing/specifications/test_data.md)
- [Modules](/docs/contributing/specifications/modules.md)
- [Subworkflows](/docs/contributing/specifications/subworkflows.md)
- [Pipelines](/docs/contributing/guidelines/)

These specifications can also be useful when reviewing pull requests of new or existing components, to ensure they reach nf-core standards.
