Building pipelines is one thing, but have you ever wanted to make a contribution
to Nextflow itself?

Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels)) takes us through his recent
experience of updating the Nextflow terminal output to use fancy colours 🌈
with a live demo of how to make and try out running the changes locally.
