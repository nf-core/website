# Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather. If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

We will create a safe list of registered participants that will be able to access the hackathon space. Make sure you register with the e-mail address you will use to access Gather.

<!--
To join, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Follow [this link](https://app.gather.town/app/br78S294XBCL487A/nf-core-hackathon) to find the Gather space
   - Please note that the hackathon space will not open until the event
2. Enter the email address you used to register for the hackathon
   - This is the same address from which you received this email
3. Check your email for a one-time code and enter it into the Gather window
4. Enter the space and enjoy the hackathon!

# In person: Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2024 we hope to replicate and build on that success! 🚀

Although the hackathon is online, to get the best of both worlds, we encourage everyone to create a local site or attend a nearby site. Be it with your group, institute, city, or region, local sites will be a lot of fun!

> Reminder: Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.

## How to create a local site

Anyone can organise a local site. It can be as simple as booking a room and getting some of your friends and colleagues together.

If you would like to create a local site, please join the local [site organisers Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06E1CY29H9) and tell us about your plans. Then, make a pull request to add your site to the table below.

When site registration closes, we will open participant registration with your site listed as an attendance option and you will be updated with the list of participants.
