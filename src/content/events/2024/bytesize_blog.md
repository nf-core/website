Since the 12th of January 2024, we have an official nf-core blog at [nf-co.re/blog](https://nf-co.re/blog). While it will be used by the core team and developers to update the community about ongoing project, it is also a great way for you to get active! Matthias Hörtenhuber ([@mashehu](https://github.com/mashehu)) will introduce us to the vision for the brand new and shiny blog and how you can contribute to it.
