> Researchers around the world use cloud technology to quickly analyze massive data pipelines,
> store petabytes of data, and share their results with collaborators around the world.
> Join this webinar to learn how AWS helps researchers process complex workloads by providing
> the cost-effective, scalable, and secure compute, storage, and database capabilities needed to accelerate time-to-science.

Phil Ewels ([@ewels](http://github.com/ewels/)) will give a talk about how the cloud is used at the
[National Genomics Infrastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/), part of [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se) in Sweden.
This will cover some of the nitty-gritty of the how and why we are making the transition to the cloud.
The talk will go on to describe how nf-core workflows make the most of cloud computing with open-data hosting,
large-scale benchmark automation and integration with user-friendly launch interfaces.

For the second part of the webinar, experts from AWS will talk about research on AWS.
