# Welcome

Join us in-person or online for the October 2023 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2023**_ in Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸. You can find out more information about the summit at [https://summit.nextflow.io](https://summit.nextflow.io).

In addition to the in-person event, we will run a free virtual option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

:::info
This hackathon is not meant to be a training event.
It is aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.

If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there are free online workshops in September.
For more information and the training registration link, see the
[Community Foundational Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-basic-2023)
and [Community Advanced Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-sept-2023) pages.

The hackathon is also being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather.

1. Follow [this link](https://app.gather.town/app/br78S294XBCL487A/nf-core-hackathon) to find the Gather space
    - Please note that the hackathon space will not open until the event.
2. Enter the email address you used to register for the hackathon
    - This is the same address from which you received this email
3. Check your email for a one-time code and enter it into the Gather window
4. Enter the space and enjoy the hackathon!

# Pre-hackathon checklist

Ensure you have read/signed up/joined/installed the following resources before the hackathon.

-   Check you agree with the [Code of Conduct](https://nf-co.re/docs) of the event
-   If you haven't already, set up a GitHub account and [join the nf-core GitHub organization](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
-   [Join the nf-core slack](https://nf-co.re/join) and the [#hackathon-oct-2023](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C05RYJWM6AH) channel
-   Create a [Gather](https://www.gather.town/) account using the email you used to register (see above)
-   Have [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/), [nf-core/tools](https://nf-co.re/tools/#installation), and one of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), Singularity, or [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)/[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your computer
-   Familiarize yourself with the [documentation on the nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/docs)

# Groups

To keep things manageable everyone will be organized into groups.
You are free to change groups at any time during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/47).
There is a separate tab for each group that will have a list of relevant issues for you to work on. We'll have daily presentations where group leaders share an overview of what happened in that day in their group. Everyone will use [the same slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fhf_hK9gBWsqNXRBYpL9pvh4hGapEWwMShNR0qmNivA/edit?usp=sharing) and change the respective slides of their groups.

## Hackathon focus: nf-test

At this hackathon, our special topic is [nf-test](https://code.askimed.com/nf-test/) 🚀

nf-test is a testing framework for Nextflow code.
We want to start using it for all nf-core pipelines and modules.
Some proof-of-concept work has already been done, with standardised implementation
patterns mostly worked out, but there's still a lot of work to add this in for all components.

There are nf-test related projects in several of the groups below.
It would be great to move nf-test adoption forward during the event!

## Meta groups

These groups are here to support anyone who may need help getting started at the hackathon.
They are not intended for focused task-specific work.

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners" intro_video="ACLM3BFpHbM" leaders={{
    'mribeirodantas': 'Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas',
    'abhi18av': 'Abhinav Sharma',
    'FranBonath': 'Franziska Bonath'
}}>
    For this hackathon, we will  have no designated beginners group but will instead
    have a "beginners table" **on the first day**.
    You're welcome to join to get help on how to contribute to open-source,
    and to meet other community contribution beginners.

    Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of building with Nextflow.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Online"
    leaders={{
        yuukiiwa: 'Yuk Kei',
        louperelo: 'Louisa Perelo',
        abhi18av: 'Abhinav Sharma',
    }}
>
    If you're feeling lost in Gather.town, or just want to hang out with other online attendees, look out for Yuk Kei
    and Louisa. They'll be able to steer you in the right direction and get you started with one of the project groups.
</HackathonGroup>

## Project groups

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines" color="#bf4b8a" intro_video="AIazn2YhW4I" proj_url="https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/47/views/4" slack="#hackathon-oct-2023-pipelines" leaders={{
    'drpatelh': 'Harshil Patel',
    'adamrtalbot': 'Adam Talbot',
    'MaxUlysse': 'Maxime Garcia',
    'Emiller88': 'Edmund Miller',
    'sateeshperi': 'Sateesh Peri',
}}>
    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test within pipelines
    - Adding new functionality to existing pipelines
    - Updating pipelines to use the latest nf-core template, via template syncs
    - Teams formed around work on specific pipelines
    - Azure megatests roll-out in pipelines

</HackathonGroup>

    'JoseEspinosa': 'Jose Espinosa-Carrasco',
    'FriederikeHanssen': 'Friederike Hanssen'
}}>
    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows
    at [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

    'mashehu': 'Matthias Hörtenhuber',
    'mirpedrol': 'Júlia Mir Pedrol',
    'nvnieuwk': 'Nicolas Vannieuwkerke'
}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
    If you'd like to make a difference to nf-core without writing any Nextflow code,
    this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Subworkflows nf-core/tools infrastructure
    - Template customisation with feature flags
    - Stripped down/customisable nf-core pipeline template
