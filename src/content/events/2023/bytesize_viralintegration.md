# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/viralintegration

nf-core/viralintegration is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for the identification of viral integration events in genomes using a chimeric read approach. It was initially based on the [CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder](https://github.com/broadinstitute/CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder). Alyssa Briggs ([@alyssa-ab](https://github.com/alyssa-ab)) will introduce us to nf-core/viralintegration by showing it's use cases.
**!! Please be aware of the changed starting time of 14:30 CEST !!**
