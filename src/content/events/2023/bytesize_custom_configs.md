One of our first bytesize talks described the use of nf-core configs in the context of nf-core pipelines (you can find it here on [youtube](https://youtu.be/cXBYusdjrc0)). In an extension to this previous talk, today Judith ([@jbv2](https://github.com/jbv2)) will explain how nf-core configs can be used in custom Nextflow pipelines.
