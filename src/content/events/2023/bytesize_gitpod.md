# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: Setting up a gitpod environment

Bytesize is back! We start the autumn session with a talk to aid anyone participating in the nextflow and nf-core training. Marcel ([@mribeirodantas](https://github.com/mribeirodantas)) is going to show how to setup and use a gitpod environment. This will be used in the training event starting on the 6th, so definitively worth a watch if you intend to participate!
