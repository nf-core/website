Bytesize is back! We start the autumn session with a talk to aid anyone participating in the nextflow and nf-core training. Marcel ([@mribeirodantas](https://github.com/mribeirodantas)) is going to show how to setup and use a gitpod environment. This will be used in the training event starting on the 6th, so definitively worth a watch if you intend to participate!
