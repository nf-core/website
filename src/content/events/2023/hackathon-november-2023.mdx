# Welcome

Join us in person for the November 2023 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2023**_ in Boston, America 🇺🇸. You can find out more information about the summit at https://summit.nextflow.io.

:::info{.fa-globe title="In-person event"}
The Boston nf-core hackathon will be in person only, without the hybrid / online features that we have used in other events (eg. Gather Town).
Anyone is free to join remotely, as we will be using the same GitHub Project boards and Slack communication as usual, but please be aware that we won't actively be trying to run this as a hybrid event.
:::

:::warning{.fa-graduation-cap}
This hackathon is not meant to be a training event and is aimed at people that already have an understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.
If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there are recordings of online workshops from September 2023 that cover foundational and advance Nextflow usage.
See the [Community Foundational Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-basic-2023) and [Community Advanced Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-sept-2023) pages for more information and links to the training material.

# Groups

This nf-core hackathon does not have formalized projects.
Instead, we have GitHub issues that are categorized into groups.
The groups are used to help organise issues, discussion, and reporting during the hackathon.
You are not restricted to staying in any single group and are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.
You are welcome to add your own issues to the hackathon so others can join you.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/56).
There will be a separate tab for each group where will collate relevant issues.
You are welcome to add your own issues to the project board so others can join you.

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners"  slack="#hackathon-nov-2023-beginners" leaders={{
    'vdauwera': 'Geraldine Van der Auwera'
}}>
    For this hackathon, we will have no designated beginners group but will instead
    have a "beginners table".
    You're welcome to join to get help on how to contribute to open-source,
    and to meet other community contribution beginners.

    Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of building with Nextflow.
