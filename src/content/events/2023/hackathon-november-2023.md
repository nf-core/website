This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.
If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there will be free online workshops spanning all global timezones in September.

# Groups

To keep work and discussion during the hackathon manageable, we will organise everyone into groups. You are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub project board (we’ll post a link to here closer to the time). There will be a separate tab for each group where will have collated a list of relevant issues.
# Venue: Boston Park Plaza

The in-person hackathon will be taking place in at the Boston Park Plaza. More information about this venue can be found the the Nextflow Summit website.
