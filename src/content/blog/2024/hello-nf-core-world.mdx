## Greetings, nf-core Community

Today marks the launch of the nf-core blog, a new avenue for keeping our community informed and connected.
This blog will serve as a central hub for in-depth updates and discussions.

## Our Vision for the Blog

This platform is created with the intent to:

-   Share substantive updates from our community’s activities. For example, descriptions of features included in a pipeline release.
-   Provide clarity on decisions made by the core and maintainers' group.
-   Offer recaps of nf-core events and hackathons.
-   Announce and detail updates to nf-core tools.

## Content Snapshot

Expect concise, informative posts covering:

-   **Community News**: Insights into our collective advancements and achievements.
-   **Technical Insights**: Explanations of decisions and updates from our technical leadership.
-   **Event Highlights**: Overviews of key takeaways from various nf-core gatherings.
-   **Tool Updates**: Announcements and insights into the latest nf-core tool releases.
-   **Other Topics**: Other topics relevant to the nf-core community.

All contributions need to align with the nf-core [code of conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct).

## Contribution Made Easy

Contributing to this blog is quite straight forward. You just need to add a markdown (or MDX) file to the `src/content/blog` folder.
The file name title of the post separated by dashes. For example, `hello-nf-core-world.mdx`.
Fill in the frontmatter (the stuff between the three dashes on the top of the markdown files) and start writing your post.

## Follow Along

Similar to the events page, also our blog posts come with an RSS feed. Subscribe to it at [https://nf-co.re/blog/rss.xml](https://nf-co.re/blog/rss.xml) to stay up to date with the latest posts.
