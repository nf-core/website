This release comes with a lot of neat little improvements and bug fixes.

# Highlights

-   More responsive nf-core-bot: If you add a `@nf-core-bot fix linting`
    comment in a PR to fix linting errors, there will be reactions added
    to the comment to indicate the status of the fix:
    -   👀 fixing action has started
    -   👍🏻 Everything looks good, nothing to fix
    -   🎉 Fixed errors and commited the changes
    -   😕 Something went wrong, please check the logs (also a comment with a link
        to the logs is added)
        <Image src={fix_linting} alt="Screenshot of the nf-core-bot fix linting comment" />
-   The `nf-core tui` subcommand launches a TUI (terminal user interface) to
    intuitively explore the command line flags, built using
    [Trogon](https://github.com/Textualize/trogon) (more TUIs to come!)
    <img src={tui.src} alt="Demo gif of the TUI." class="img-fluid" />.
-   If you need an svg version or a bigger png version of an nf-core pipeline logo,
    you can now use the new `nf-core logo-create` subcommand to output one.
-   Speaking of logos, the pipeline READMEs now use the [new(-ish) github image syntax](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-15-specify-theme-context-for-images-in-markdown-ga/).
-   Every pipeline now has a GitHub Action Workflow that tests a
    successful download with `nf-core download`.
-   Goodbye `-profile docker, test` errors: We check now if the `-profile` parameter is
    well formatted to avoid this common pitfall.
-   Fun changes on the tooling side:

    -   The longer CI tests for the tools repo are now run on self-hosted runners on
        AWS (thanks for the sponsorship AWS!).
    -   We've got a new bot which helps us to keep the changelog up to date.
        Big thanks to [@vladsavelyev](https://github.com/vladsavelyev) for the code!
    -   We now use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting, goodbye to Black, isort and pyupgrae
        and thank you for your service!🫡.

        :::tip

        -   We included ruff to the pre-commit config. Use `pre-commit install` to install the git hook scripts.
        -   To lint on save with VSCode, add the following settings:

        ```json title=".vscode/settings.json"
        "[python]": {
            "editor.formatOnSave": true,
            "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
                "source.fixAll": true,
                "source.organizeImports": true
            },
            "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"
        }
        ```

        -   To run ruff manually you can use `ruff check .` and `ruff format .`.
