# sanger-tol/pipelines-website - Contributing Guidelines

Hi there! Many thanks for taking an interest in improving the sanger-tol website.

## Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for sanger-tol/pipelines-website, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the
   [sanger-tol/pipelines-website issues]([https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re/issues](https://github.com/sanger-tol/pipelines-website/issues)) to avoid duplicating work.
   - If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. Fork the [sanger-tol/pipelines-website repository](https://github.com/sanger-tol/pipelines-website) to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository
4. Submit a Pull Request against the `main` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged.

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [basic docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or even their [excellent interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/).

## Tests

When you create a pull request with changes, Github Actions will run automatic tests.
Typically, pull-requests are only fully reviewed when these tests are passing, though of course we can help out before then.
For now, the only test is for Markdown syntax, using the `markdownlint` package.
